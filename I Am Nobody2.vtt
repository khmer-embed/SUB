00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.080
It would be nice

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.560
if Dou found me some of this type of prey next time.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.230
It's heavy.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.560
What are you looking for?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.280
I'm your opponent.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.440
It's object manipulation.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.280
Man.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.750
You have a good eye.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.870
How many years have you been practicing?

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.990
More than 20 years.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.800
More than 20 years?

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.750
You had a hard time dealing with my iron ball.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.080
What a loser.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.040
You have a magic weapon.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.750
Without it,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.080
you would've been kicked to death.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.200
You couldn't even defend yourself against my kicking.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.200
Tell me.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.680
How many years have you been practicing?

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.320
I'm flattered.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.280
I've been practicing for 20 days.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.680
Do you have a problem with that?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.630
Twenty days? Unbelievable.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.280
I'll show you.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.710
Don't say my weapon is lame.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.870
Your gadgets and cleverness

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.280
are useless

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.590
in front of my magic weapon.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.750
Qiu.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.870
You're playful.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.440
But if that hurts you,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.920
that's not good.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.800
Besides,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.440
I think

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.630
they are asking for trouble.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.400
Actually, I've already seen it.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.040
Your protections

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.200
are for malicious attacks.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.230
But I'll bear you no ill will.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.160
I created

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.990
this fist technique.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.400
Massage the acupuncture points

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.040
to make people's glands

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.280
secrete dopamine

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.560
until

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.280
they become what you are now.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.110
Remember.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.750
This trick

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.400
is called Massage of Love.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.710
Chen Duo also has protection.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.120
Why isn't it

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.440
working on Ms. Bao?

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.880
We're colleagues.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.600
We shouldn't fight.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.360
Be good.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.360
Come back with us.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.230
I won't hit you.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.030
Are you also

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.160
from the company?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.990
My name is Feng Baobao.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.710
His name is Zhang Chulan.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.360
We were ordered to bring you back to the company.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880
You were ordered?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.750
Bring it on.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.200
There is a limit to the protection of magic weapons.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.310
Even if I could break through it,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600
I wouldn't have to.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.680
The question is,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.920
why does Chen Duo have protection?

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.270
What does she have to do

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.640
with that weapon Outsider?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.840
Your qi is special.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.920
Can you teach me?

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.070
You won't learn.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.960
Why?

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.440
To learn this,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.680
your body will rot little by little.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.270
Do you still want to learn?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.990
Protections

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.440
didn't work on her.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.990
It's normal.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.030
Your protections are automatic and lame.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.180
[Qiu Rang, Armorer]

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.640
She's strong.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.550
She's all right.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.270
Are you all right, Ms. Bao?

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.360
I'm all right.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.400
Who are you?

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.030
You're in luck today.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.440
Prepare to be amazed.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.230
Not everyone

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.750
can see my gilded ruyi.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.710
And my emerald ring

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.710
can resist all attacks.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.640
Run.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.510
That guy

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.710
broke his protection.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.790
He's hiding deeper than we are.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.840
Where is Chen Duo?

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.400
She escaped.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.790
We were this close to catching her.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.790
But a guy with magic weapons came out of nowhere

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.960
and rescued Chen Duo.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.750
We found out

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.790
that Chen Duo also has protection,

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.440
just like the other Outsiders.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.400
We need to think carefully.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.640
You broke the rules, didn't you?

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.550
We have two people

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.840
from Lubei.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.710
I'm not.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.120
She's from Lubei.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.840
You can call her Baobao.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.790
It has always been the code name

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.600
of temporary workers in Lubei.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.400
I'm just an assistant.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.120
Don't ask too much.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.790
Which of you is in charge?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.230
- He is. - She is.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.960
The man from Luzhong

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.840
and the girl from Northeast are the only ones I haven't met.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.270
It was my fault

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.270
that Chen Duo escaped.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.400
I gave her time to react.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.840
I missed the best chance to complete the task.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.960
Meng.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.070
You have dealt with Chen Duo.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.440
Why did she say

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.680
you were the one who deserved to die?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.990
There must be some misunderstanding here.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.550
I didn't hurt Chen Duo.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.200
We never spoke

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.880
after our first meeting.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.510
Five years ago,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.270
I took a task

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.230
to destroy an illegal organization called the Medicine Immortal Association.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.640
Liao also participated

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.270
in that task.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.600
It's said that the Medicine Immortal Association

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.990
is from a space we can't recognize.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.120
Everything there is unconventional.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.230
Qi operates in a way we don't understand.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.360
It's a veritable forbidden place for Outsiders.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.120
The Medicine Immortal Association

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.470
acts strangely.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.960
They worship a strange kind of energy.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.510
They take a poison of unknown origin

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.790
as their god.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200
And they think of it as a sacred relic

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.960
handed down from generation to generation.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.960
The Medicine Immortal Association

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.470
brutally trains those who inherit poison arts.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.880
They cut them off from the outside world

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.680
until they lose their sense

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.160
of being human.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.510
In their world,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.790
they only know poison arts.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.230
The most outstanding one

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.400
is Chen Duo.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:18.990
She was called

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.510
Saint Poison Girl.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.940
[Saint Poison Girl]

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.070
The other members of the Immortal Medicine Association

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.600
deserve to die.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.680
But Chen Duo is innocent.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.920
She's a victim.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.470
The Medicine Immortal Association made her into what she is now.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.680
She didn't have a choice.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.200
Girl.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600
Don't be afraid.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.030
Come with me.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.710
Liao and I took her

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.400
from the Medicine Immortal Association.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.470
At that time,

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.550
Liao was in charge of the Bunker.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.230
The Bunker is a research facility for special Outsiders.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.440
He took the lead

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.510
in getting Chen Duo to the Bunker

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.680
for treatment.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.470
Let's go.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.310
I whine

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.120
when dealing

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.960
with dangerous tasks.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.680
When I met Chen Duo,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.550
I couldn't say anything.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.440
She was never trained

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.400
to be a human

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.960
after birth.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.360
Then,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.200
she spent many years in the Bunker.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.990
It was Liao...

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.990
It was Liao who made her a temporary worker.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.920
Although she could not live

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.200
like an ordinary girl,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.920
she was at least like a human being.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.680
I'll be blunt.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.790
Cut the nonsense.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.640
I'm not interested in your story.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.030
I just want to finish this task as soon as possible.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.400
An order from the headquarters.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.480
[Headquarters]
If the poison on Chen Duo spreads,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.940
it will cause great damage.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.030
The situation is critical.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.030
Catching Chen Duo is of great importance.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.480
If you encounter strong resistance or are in danger of your life,

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.150
you can decide for yourself what to do.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.400
Although this is an order from the headquarters,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.070
I'd like to ask for a favor.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.960
If Chen Duo doesn't want to come back to the company with us,

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.710
please don't hurt her first.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.600
I want to persuade her.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.510
After all, Chen Duo is not a bad person.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.030
Qiu. Xiao.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.400
You've seen it.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.710
She didn't try to kill us.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.310
I know I'm no match for you.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.710
If you insist on going your own way,

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.840
I will...

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.410
[Northeast]
I support Meng.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.410
There is room for maneuver.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.210
We'll find a way to catch her alive.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.040
[Luzhong]
Agree.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.120
Chen Duo.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.510
It doesn't matter.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.960
Maybe something more interesting will emerge.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.270
Qiu.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.120
Her tricks are interesting.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.470
Only by capturing her alive

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.990
can I know her origins.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.750
I agree.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.160
Let's catch her alive.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.120
Lubei's people.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.680
What do you say?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.270
Since it's okay with you,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.920
it's okay with us.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.470
The matter is complicated.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.470
We'll only be able to figure it out if we catch her alive.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.270
I think the headquarters wants

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.270
to complete the task

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.600
and get some information.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.600
Ms. Bao.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.790
What do you think?

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.200
Agree.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.310
Thank you.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.160
Looks like all their attention

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.640
centers on Chen Duo.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.680
But the biggest threat is the attitude of the headquarters

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.550
towards temporary workers.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.270
Tell me what you're thinking.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.680
I don't treat you like a stranger.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.070
I told you.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.510
I think

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.680
it's complicated.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.600
But I don't know why.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.200
I'm just a worker.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.710
As long as I can save Chen Duo,

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.990
I will do whatever the headquarters says.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.360
I don't mind.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.070
I just want to deal with a few fresh people.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.510
I don't care

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.750
about anything else.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.440
It seems

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.990
that they can perceive the attitude of the headquarters.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.790
Meng. Xiao.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.270
What do you mean?

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:51.990
What they mean is that

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.680
we're

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880
being played.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.960
What?

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.120
By whom?

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.440
The people above.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.510
People above, come out.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.990
I saw you.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.030
Get down.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.160
I'm referring

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.640
to the company,

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.680
the board of directors.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.070
On the face of it,

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.880
this joint operation is about catching Chen Duo.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.600
But actually, it's about temporary workers.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.550
This is called

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.310
achieving a goal by any means.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.230
No wonder.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.990
The attitude of the headquarters towards us

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.400
has always been subtle.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.920
Although temporary workers are very useful,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.920
the headquarters

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.510
can't direct us.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.070
Plus, we're a hidden danger

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.120
to the headquarters.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.920
The headquarters delegated the task to us.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.790
As long as we can satisfy the headquarters,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.960
you're good,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.120
I'm good,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.070
and everyone is good.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.120
What if the headquarters is not satisfied?

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.160
Then, all of us

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.270
will die a terrible death.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.200
It's a pity.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.270
But we all understand

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.510
that temporary workers are nice.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.790
For example,

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.550
Bao.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.160
To the headquarters,

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.270
she's more like a weapon

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.160
of the second generation

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.550
of the Xu family

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.070
than a special agent.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.600
If that's the case,

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.920
I'm the same.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.710
Guys.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.160
What do you think about this?

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.360
I

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.790
don't mind.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.150
I think it's a good thing.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.240
I can follow people from higher levels.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.190
In that case,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.760
we can handle the task

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.190
and get this over with.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.960
Wouldn't that

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.720
be better?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.240
Anyway,

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.470
failure is better for us.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.360
No.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.550
Qiu meant

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.030
that he wanted the headquarters

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.510
to manage the temporary workers directly.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.840
In that case, Ms. Bao's identity

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.960
will be exposed.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.110
Then I'll have to run away with Ms. Bao.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:41.190
Qiu.

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.150
Stop teasing Zhang Chulan.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.760
Look at his face.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.240
It looks terrible.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.400
Xiao.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.070
What do you think of the two people

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.990
from Lubei?

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:00.840
Sword.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.800
Swordsmen.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.240
It's weird.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.280
Basically,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.630
we don't communicate with people

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.070
from the company other than our supervisors

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.470
when we carry out our tasks.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.070
If we need help,

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.840
we look for people outside the company

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.360
through our contacts.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.800
However,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.190
both of you are here.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400
Anyway,

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.990
you seem to be afraid

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.880
that the headquarters will take

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.280
away Baobao's management rights.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.320
Temporary workers

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.840
are not normal people.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.720
You seem to care

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.630
about their troubles.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.190
I don't care about it.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.840
Chulan.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.840
If you have anything you want to ask,

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.800
just ask.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.070
You don't have to beat around the bush.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.470
And

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.320
I'm satisfied with my supervisor.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.320
On my birthday last month,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.070
Dou specifically arranged a task for me

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.400
to celebrate my birthday.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.190
It's good.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.470
I don't want to change anything.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.960
I'm counting on you

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.630
this time.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.360
Let's work together.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.110
They've already made their decision.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.720
Their discussion was just a test of each other.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.070
I have to be more careful

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.030
with these freaks.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.460

Chen Duo showed up.

She's heading to Mei Jinfeng's.

Look what you've done.

I want to ask Xiao to kill you.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.960
I'm poor. I have no choice.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.400
The car was damaged.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.280
I lost all my travel expenses.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:01.990
I have no choice

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:03.800
but to travel in this environment-friendly way.

You and Wang Zhenqiu

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.110
were in our car, too.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.150
Can you pay half of the compensation?

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.800
Xiao.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.360
Say something.

He's blackmailing us.

Chulan.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.470
You'd better stay away from me,

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.990
especially when I'm upset.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.470
Meng.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.440
Xiao asked me to stay away from him.

Why are you riding so fast?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.030
According to the information Erzhuang provided,

Let's hurry up

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.880
and figure out

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.150
how Chen Duo got involved

this will get serious.

wanted to take Jinfeng away.
