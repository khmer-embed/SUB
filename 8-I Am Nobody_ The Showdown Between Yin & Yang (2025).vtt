00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.710
What happened to the house?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.230
Why is it gone?

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.950
Meng, Qiu,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.590
is there any signal left on your phones?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.430
I have no signal.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.070
Same here.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.680
Looks like Ma Xianhong has stepped in,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.200
hiding Chen Duo

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.480
and blocking our signal.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.030
As expected of one of the Eight Supremes,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.240
Ma Xianhong's Divine Forge

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.080
can even make a house disappear into thin air.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.150
All right, Meng,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.030
you and Qiu figure out a way to contact the company.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.910
I'll go find someone to break his Divine Forge.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.910
The signal was suddenly cut off,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.080
and all the temporary workers are unreachable.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.240
We've gathered concrete evidence

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.000
that Ma Xianhong and the Refining Furnace

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.910
will bring a great disaster to the Outsiders' world.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.000
But now, with the temporary workers missing,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.430
the worst-case scenario

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.800
is that they've been swayed by Ma Xianhong,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.430
just like Chen Duo.

[This is a work of fiction.]

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.310
The signal's gone, right?

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.910
Weren't you eager

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.590
to get out?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.080
I tried my best,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.750
but I didn't succeed.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.830
I'll leave the rest to Zhang Chulan.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.000
He'll figure out a way to find me.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.360
Do you know how to play this?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.120
I'll show you.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.000
Tap this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.750
to start.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
You can hold it.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.720
Tap here to begin,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.070
then these are for movements,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.920
and these are for continuous sprinting.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.800
You can try this.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.360
You need to press here

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.120
Yes, just like that.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.870
That's right.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.680
Here.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.600
Move faster.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.390
I'll take care of this.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.070
Someone's coming.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.120
Watch me work my magic.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.920
Now, it's in this direction.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.830
You remind me of my friend.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.950
That Chen Junyan who taught you basketball?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.920
Why didn't you go find him after you left the Bunker?

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.680
I went out to look for him,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.630
but couldn't find him.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.750
He's an alien.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.120
He's probably already left Earth.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.830
An alien?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.920
If you can make friends with aliens,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.510
then you must be one yourself.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.190
You two will meet again.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.190
Where will you go

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.560
once you're out?

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.070
I'll go look for Zhang Chulan.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.950
Jump.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.560
It's your turn.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.630
There are two of them left.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.750
Go for it.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.600
Keep it up.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.560
You won!

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.950
You won on your first try.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.160
You're so fierce.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.920
Fierce?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.480
It means you are impressive.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.800
You are so impressive.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.120
The whole mountain has been scoured,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.560
yet Biyou Village is nowhere to be found.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.720
Those temporary workers

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.750
most likely deceived us

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.680
right from the start.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.120
The situation is clear:

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.720
they've already broken free

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.560
from the headquarters' control.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.160
Zhao,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.950
if the temporary workers have teamed up with Ma Xianhong,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.480
the consequences could be disastrous.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.600
We can't afford to wait any longer.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.510
Issue the order to capture Ma Xianhong

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.430
and activate the highest-level emergency plan immediately.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.600
It's a call from the Northeast Region's Gao Lian.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.920
Got it.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.240
Gao Erzhuang's consciousness must always

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.560
stay connected to her body,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.830
or it could be dangerous.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.870
She has never lost

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.120
this connection

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.680
with her body before.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.310
But according to Gao Lian's information,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.120
just as we lost track

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.560
of the temporary workers,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.480
Gao Erzhuang also lost

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.870
connection with her body.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.190
There are only two possibilities.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.000
First,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.240
she decided to commit suicide

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.830
and voluntarily severed the electromagnetic connection.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.240
Second,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.600
someone cut off the electromagnetic waves

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.750
by some means,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.000
leaving Erzhuang

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.920
unable to break free.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.600
How much time does Erzhuang have left?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600
Half an hour at most.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.240
If Gao Erzhuang can't reconnect

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.720
to her body through the electromagnetic waves

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.830
within that time,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.560
she'll surely die.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.510
This village seems suspicious.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.720
Someone's blocked our signal.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.560
Where is everyone else?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360
There's a ghost!

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.430
A ghost!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.950
Open the door!

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.860
[I'm Erzhuang.]

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.750
You're...

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.870
Er...Erzhuang?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.600
How can you prove it?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.480
Ma,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.390
what's the meaning of this?

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.390
Why did you hide

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.840
Chen Duo and Feng Baobao?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.550
Are you declaring war on us?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.440
You don't need to worry.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.240
Feng Baobao won't be in any danger.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.030
Then bring Feng Baobao back to us first.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.120
If you're concerned about Feng Baobao,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.030
your real worry should be your company,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.630
not me.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.320
What's this?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.030
The truth.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.720
What is she trying to say?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.550
I understand now.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.080
You don't have to swear.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.840
Are you saying that your surname

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.870
is Gao?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.960
She's saying

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.630
that you're not right in the head

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.390
and should spend more time in the sun.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.750
She didn't say anything.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.790
How do you know?

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.980
[Someone's trying to kill me.]

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.060
[Help me.]

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.360
Check it out.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.480
Do you think the headquarters

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.360
fully entrusted Liao Zhong with the power

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.030
to end Chen Duo?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.120
This

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.480
is the real ending they planned

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.750
for her.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
To be honest,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.000
I was there the night Chen Duo

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.960
killed Liao Zhong.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.080
I was worried about her

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.440
going to see him alone.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.790
And it turned out I was right to follow her.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.320
What have you

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.360
done to me?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.480
Now,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.670
Mr. Liao,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:02.960
end my life.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.080
No.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.240
Bi,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.720
you have the switch in your hand too?

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.630
Everyone,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.320
as the person responsible for this incident,

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.910
Liao Zhong has completely failed in his duties.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.630
If possible,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.670
I wouldn't want to intervene.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.360
Just as I thought.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.960
The headquarters pressed the switch,

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.870
but why is Chen Duo unharmed?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.390
When I returned the collar,

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.840
I also took

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.320
their control over it.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.150
So,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.510
at that moment, Chen Duo

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.910
was already dead as an NDT Express employee.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.360
Now, the girl

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.240
called Chen Duo who survived

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.550
should live a different life.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.200
Zhang Chulan,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.150
I can understand

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.240
NDT Express's lack of sympathy

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.870
for Chen Duo,

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.630
but you're in the same situation as her,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.270
yet you side with them.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.480
I don't get it.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.910
Have you ever thought

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.750
about how the company would treat Feng Baobao

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.720
if she were the one who made a mistake?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.510
What choice

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.000
would you make then?

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.480
Since you've come to Biyou Village,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.270
stay here

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.030
and break free from NDT Express's control,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.750
just like Chen Duo.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.150
I'll help you.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.840
Ma Xianhong,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600
your self-righteousness

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.720
has completely clouded your judgment.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.120
You keep saying

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.750
that NDT Express is manipulating us,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.080
but your presenting your so-called kindness and justice

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.080
in such an eloquent manner

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.600
is just another way for you to try to control me.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.630
Ma,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.030
I truly can't see through you.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.320
Are you a madman

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.320
or a sage?

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.150
People like you are the hardest to deal with.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.480
On the surface, it seems like you have no weaknesses,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.790
but a person's desires

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.600
are their weaknesses.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.910
I saw you cry when watching

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.670
the puppet show,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.390
but you

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.720
are not nearly as powerful as you think you are.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.480
So?

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.360
Don't go head-to-head with the company.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.720
You don't stand a chance.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.150
Ma Xianhong,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.000
have you thought

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.550
about what kind of consequences

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.870
your actions will bring to the Outsiders' world?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.720
Watch me roll.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.200
Electromagnetic waves transfer.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.720
Easy as pie.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.510
Here I come!

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.790
Oops, I've been spotted.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.390
Let me transfer the waves again.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.160
What's going on?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.920
Seriously? My teammate's a total disaster.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.160
Why did you shatter them all?

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.880
I might as well be dead.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.550
These two are complete fools.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.000
What happened to her?

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.550
Erzhuang.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.590
She has already done her best.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.720
Who said I was dead?

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.590
There are still faint traces of electromagnetic waves

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.680
lingering in Ruhua's limbs.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.510
I'll gather them

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.110
and reassemble a new body.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.240
Is this Erzhuang?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.550
What is she trying to do?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.590
She's heading upwards.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.680
Maybe she's trying to break the blockade

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.830
and find a signal?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.270
The signal's cut off,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.480
and the exit's blocked.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.920
This Ma Xianhong…

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.140
[Biyou Village]

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.420
[Biyou Village]

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.960
We're back in touch with the temporary workers.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.590
You need to use the strength of your wrist to play basketball.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.110
Isn't it enough to just get it in the hoop?

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.240
Let me use qi.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.860
[Biyou Village]

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.030
Bao, can you hear me?

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:03.920
Bao.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.310
I'm here.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.350
This is weird.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.110
Why are you above me?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.750
What is this place?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.000
These were all created

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.550
by Ma Xianhong using the Divine Forge.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.960
This guy

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
really thinks of himself as the Creator.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.070
Bao,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.550
what I'm about to say next is very important.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.160
You must pay attention.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.830
I need you to ask Chen Duo one last question.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.590
Chen Duo,

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.240
I'm going up.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.750
Do you want to come with me?

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.480
Chen Duo.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.880
Chen Duo,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.160
if you could leave here

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.720
and go anywhere,

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.680
is there a place you'd like to go?

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.720
I don't

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.510
think so.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.000
No, not really.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.960
Then...

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.000
Then...

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.590
We'll offer you a choice.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.510
We'll offer you a choice.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.000
Bao,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.510
you can come down now.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400
The rest

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.000
will be up to Chen Duo.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.830
No matter what you choose,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.680
we'll meet again.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.160
That's right, Bao.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.310
It's right here!

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.960
You...

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.240
Are you all right, Bao?

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.480
I'm fine.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.720
[Northeast Region]
It's been a while, folks.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.720
Erzhuang?

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.440
I knew

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.160
you wouldn't be taken out so easily.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.960
[Northeast Region]
Obviously.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.130
I'm an invincible beauty

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.680
with max vitality.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.110
Also,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:58.930
thanks.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.920
Yay.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.200
Guan.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.240
Wow, this place had quite some action going on.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.310
Meng,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.640
looks like we missed out on something.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.270
As I suspected, the sun is fake.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.000
I knew something was off.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.830
If we didn't have to eliminate Ma Xianhong,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.960
I'd really like to learn a few moves from him.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.000
It looks like Biyou Village

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.310
was all conjured by Ma Xianhong.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.960
Now, we're stuck in a situation

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.960
where he's got us trapped.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.110
We've reached the designated coordinates.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.400
Thermal imaging shows unusually active readings.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.640
Biyou Village is probably hidden in the area,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.110
but we cannot locate the exact target.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.030
The village has always

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.510
been right under our noses,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.030
but we never saw it.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.200
Thanks to the coordinates

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.510
sent by Erzhuang,

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.750
we can now confirm

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.590
that the village

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.400
is hidden within this mountain.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.440
Ma Xianhong must have used some kind of illusion

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.550
to hide it,

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.920
and we still cannot confirm

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.160
its exact location.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.400
Looks like

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.000
it's time to deal with

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.880
the threat posed by Biyou Village.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.960
What's the situation with the temporary workers now?

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.240
They are still waiting for our instructions.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.790
Waiting?

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.110
The situation is already so clear.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.030
What are they still waiting for?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.070
They should take action.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.270
Such an unclear command to take action

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.920
could lead these special agents

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.070
to think that headquarters has abandoned them.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.640
How are they supposed to proceed

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:50.680
without any support?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.030
You were pretty hard

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.200
on the special agents before.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.920
What made you soften up now?

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.110
The reason I was hard on them

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.920
was due to my lack of trust.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.000
Despite that, I know

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.640
that we shouldn't play games with the brothers on the front line.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.510
Right now,

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.110
they need a clear response from us,

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.720
and our instructions mustn't be ambiguous.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.960
Is there any need to ask?

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.880
They should eliminate all evil

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.070
to prevent any future complications.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.640
Good.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.480
That's an excellent decision.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.200
I support you, Huang.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.070
The official order

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.200
will bear your signature and be issued by you.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.640
We're still discussing it here, aren't we?

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.270
Huang,

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.270
I've already said it.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.310
I support you.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.310
Fine.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.880
If you won't issue the order,

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.480
I will.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.110
Exterminate Biyou Village,

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.830
bring the Divine Forge back to the company,

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.070
and no personnel involved in the operation

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.240
are allowed to keep anything for themselves.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.510
Upon returning,

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.720
they must undergo an integrity investigation.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.480
This order

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.240
only needs my signature.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.030
If anything goes wrong,

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.750
I, Bi Youlong, will take full responsibility.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.350
Great.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.720
Mr. Bi, you are a man who steps up when needed.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.110
I respect you for that.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.750
Gentlemen,

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.000
calm down.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.350
There are over eighty Outsiders in Biyou Village.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.550
You want to take responsibility?

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.070
I'm afraid you aren't able

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.960
to shoulder such a responsibility on your own.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.550
If anything goes wrong,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.510
wiping it all out

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.750
might seem like a quick and efficient solution.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.790
Destruction

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.310
is, indeed, an effective method,

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.270
but gentlemen,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.960
think carefully.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.790
How many problems

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.640
have humans faced throughout history?

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.790
And even now, the world

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.920
still faces countless issues.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.350
When you look deeper,

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.310
you'll see

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.440
that humanity

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.750
is the true root of the problems.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:21.830
So, what now?

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.350
Are we to destroy everything?

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.550
What we need is stability and harmony.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.200
Problems should be addressed promptly,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.680
but the methods we use must be chosen wisely.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.200
What truly brings about collapse is going to extremes.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.400
Exterminating Biyou Village

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.590
is way too extreme.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.750
If that's the solution

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.640
going forward,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.400
then what's the point of us even being here?

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.310
We might as well just hire a group of assassins

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.680
to handle everything.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.440
Don't you think?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.480
The following

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.000
is the official order from headquarters.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.880
Ma Xianhong has lost all sense of right and wrong,

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.680
resorting to extremism.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.070
Within Biyou Village,

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.830
he is sheltering a large number of criminal Outsiders,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.920
refusing to change.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.200
He's also utilizing the Refining Furnace

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.480
to create and transform Outsiders,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.240
ignoring the balance of the Outsiders' world

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.880
and breaking the population cap.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.240
If not stopped immediately,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.750
it will cause catastrophic consequences.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.690
The Refining Furnace must be destroyed at once,

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.580
and the Divine Forge should be brought back to the company.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.200
Ma Xianhong and his associates should be captured if possible.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.480
All relevant villagers of Biyou Village should be rounded up

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.130
and taken back to the company for a thorough investigation.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.880
The temporary worker Chen Duo

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.350
has confessed to killing Liao Zhong

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.640
and should be apprehended immediately.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.750
[The temporary worker Chen Duo has confessed to killing Liao Zhong]
