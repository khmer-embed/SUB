00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.750
How much for a bowl?

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.600
Hello.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.520
Who's this?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.710
Wang Ye,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.350
how's your trip?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
Have you decided on your next stop?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.670
Who are you?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.470
If you haven't decided yet,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.790
you can come to me.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.880
Let me introduce myself.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.390
I'm Ma Xianhong,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.390
a descendant of Ma Benzai of the Divine Forge.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.710
We, the inheritors of the Eight Supremes,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.200
should gather

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.510
and do something together.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.040
You've got the wrong person.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.680
Don't be in such a rush to turn me down.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.790
Give it some thought first.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.840
By the way,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.790
one of your friends,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.150
Zhuge Qing,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.400
should already be on his way here.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.560
Let me know once you've made up your mind.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.040
I'll be waiting.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.920
Hey,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.000
Qing.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.040
Hey, Wang.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.040
What's up?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.150
Nothing.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.680
I'm just checking in on you.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.920
Have you

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.350
run into any trouble

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.400
or met anyone strange recently?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.510
I wouldn't necessarily call it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.040
trouble,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.430
but I have met

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.040
someone strange.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.040
And I'm going to a strange place with her

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.590
to meet a strange village chief.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.230
Accidents are frequent ahead.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.840
Please drive carefully.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.120
Accidents are frequent ahead.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.190
Please drive carefully.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.150
That's my voice.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.150
What do you think?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.240
Pretty nice, huh?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.470
Weirdo.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.080
What is it?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.030
Did they contact you too?

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.280
We don't know anything about these people

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.870
or their intentions.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.120
It's too dangerous.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.310
They're dangerous,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.800
but I'm no pushover either.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.910
Qing,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.960
- this... - Wang,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.520
I appreciate

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.190
the call,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.310
but this is a personal matter,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.840
so you don't have to worry about it.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.870
I wasn't surprised

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.630
by this stubborn mule's reaction.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.360
He insisted on coming,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.000
so I had no choice

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.470
but to follow him.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.390
So,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.510
did you come over because you're worried

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.040
the village chief might see me as a threat

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.630
and eliminate me?

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.120
You could say so.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.160
Wang,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.750
you really don't need to be like this.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.360
Don't feel like you owe me anything

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.430
just because you beat me once.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.750
To be honest,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.600
I still hold a grudge

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.510
about how you defeated me,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.750
but that's my issue to sort out,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.870
not yours.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.600
I really do owe you an apology.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120
The truth is,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.750
I didn't have to beat you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.720
Before the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.510
I saw in the phantasmagoria

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.870
that the Celestial Taoist was destined to face a trial.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.920
But when we got to the mountain,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.120
I realized that trial

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.240
was meant to befall you.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.000
To ensure Zhang Chulan's smooth advancement,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360
the Chief Celestial Taoist

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.800
would surely sabotage you in secret.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.390
You would lose to Zhang Chulan,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.560
but with your intelligence,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.950
you'd certainly catch on.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.190
If word got out,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.040
it would ruin the Chief Celestial Taoist's reputation.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.310
A kid like you

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.950
isn't worth involving the Chief Celestial Taoist.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.510
So

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.920
I stepped in and dealt with you.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.390
Looking back,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.720
the Chief Celestial Taoist escaped the trial,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.480
but my actions

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.720
have had a negative impact on you.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.720
I'm sorry

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.120
for altering your fate without your consent.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.750
So that's the story.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.190
My fate has indeed changed.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.390
But

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.800
whether it's for the better or worse,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.870
it's not up to you to say.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.000
Ouch.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.720
Aren't you cold?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.560
Here, let me warm your hands.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.950

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.630

Qing,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.310
it's hot!

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.680
Qing!

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.390
How's your stay

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.830
in Biyou Village?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.120
Comfortable so far?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.600
Not really.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.920
You've kept us waiting long enough.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.040
Now, care to explain

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.870
why you called us here?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600
Allow me to introduce

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000
Liu Dang,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.830
a hardcore combat enthusiast.

Wang Ye,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.720
now that you're here,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.680
do me a favor

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.040
and defeat him.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.630
Me?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.160
I'd really rather not.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.630
Wang.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.630
Oh, no.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.120
This guy clearly hasn't practiced using qi.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.240
Chief Ma,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.720
what's your game here?

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.360
Are you all right, Liu Dang?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.160
I'm fine.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.830
As you can see,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.270
Liu Dang is just an ordinary guy,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.830
a combat enthusiast

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.600
who's earned some fame

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.630
and respect in his circle.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.070
He was about to retire,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.390
but meeting

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.310
a young boy learning boxing

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.830
made him rethink everything.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.680
This little boy

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.560
seemed to be only about ten.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.680
At first, I didn't take him seriously.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.240
He came straight to me for training.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.040
I was going to go easy on him.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.160
But to my surprise,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680
during our sparring,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.070
this skinny little kid,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.680
who'd only trained for a few days,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.600
actually made me feel some pressure.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.430
I even instinctively used

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.240
my full strength.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120
Sorry about that, kiddo.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.270
Are you okay?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.630
I may have hit you harder than I intended.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.800
No worries, Dang.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.510
I asked for it.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.000
I should have listened to my master.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.680
I'm just not cut out for this.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.720
Master?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.830
The kid didn't want to say anything at first,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.750
but I won him over with my sincerity.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.030
He then agreed to take me to meet his master.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.840
[Sun's Blacksmith Shop]

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.120
It was an old man who forged blades by hand.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.150
Martial arts?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.390
I'm just a blacksmith.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.030
I don't have a clue about that.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.630
I didn't believe what the old man said,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.870
so

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.150
I asked to stay there as an apprentice.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.240
Sure,

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.630
not many youngsters

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.630
want to learn this craft these days.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.910
Let's see what you've got.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.910
To my surprise, the old man agreed right away.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.200
So,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.960
I stayed with him

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.150
to learn blade forging and blacksmithing,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.150
but I had to use

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.840
the breathing technique he taught me

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.150
to complete each strike.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.030
He said

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.910
that was the only way

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.870
to forge a good blade.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.320
Kid,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.320
if you're set on forging blades here,

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.720
I won't stop you.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.790
But I'd suggest you

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.910
head back.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.030
You won't find

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.630
what you're seeking here.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.960
I stayed there for a month.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.600
Aside from forging blades,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.670
I couldn't do anything else.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.910
I couldn't keep wasting my time like that.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.960
When I returned to the boxing gym,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.750
I trained even harder.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.360
Normally, I'd feel joy

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.870
when I made progress,

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.150
but it was different this time.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.000
The stronger I became,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.440
the more powerless I felt.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.750
No matter how many victories I achieved,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.270
they couldn't satisfy me.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.480
There was always

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.150
this lingering feeling.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.030
I felt like

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.080
I was missing something all along.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.670
Liu Dang,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.240
this is Wang Ye from Wudang,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.150
and this is Qing from the Zhuge family.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.870
After meeting them,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.630
can you feel the part

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.390
you've been missing?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.270
I...

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.270
Can I really not be like the two of them

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.480
and have that qi?

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.790
It's pointless.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.120
You don't have the talent.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.550
The breathing technique that the old man taught you

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.600
is probably his sect's method for controlling the breath,

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.150
designed to help one quickly detect

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.790
the qi within their body.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.030
But you couldn't sense it even after a month.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.870
I started at seven

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.270
and could sense it within two days.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.390
Some people, even without any techniques,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.390
can sense the qi within themselves.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.360
If someone can't detect it within two weeks,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.480
we consider them to lack the talent.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.080
Qing,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.360
don't make it sound so definite.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.000
As Outsiders,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.510
we have potential that ordinary people can't even dream of.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.320
The ability to harness qi

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.270
is as natural as breathing for us.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.440
But most people in this world,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.360
like Liu Dang,

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.360
are deprived of this ability

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.080
from birth.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.790
Our gift

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.960
is their flaw.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.150
Is that fair?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.750
Flaws have filled this world with misfits,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.960
but that's not their true purpose.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.550
This world holds countless possibilities,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.440
and everyone deserves

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.240
the chance to fix their flaws

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.320
and gain the power they long for.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.390
Don't you think?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.120
Wang Ye,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.750
do you disagree?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.200
I wouldn't say I agree or disagree,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.840
but you

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.240
have certainly piqued my interest, Chief Ma.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.200
Is that so?

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.750
That's great.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.270
The ability to sense qi is innate,

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.630
it's part of one's fate.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.790
Chief Ma,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.240
what you're saying

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.270
doesn't quite make sense.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.750
Fate, huh?

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.910
Qing,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.720
from what I know,

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.840
you're not someone who accepts fate, are you?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.440
As an Armorer,

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.600
I believe

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.080
the greatest Armorer is destiny itself.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.080
Everything in this world is shaped by destiny,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.440
and humans are no exception.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.910
They, too, can be forged.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.750
At that time, neither Qing nor I

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.910
took Ma Xianhong's words too seriously.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.840
Out of curiosity,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.750
we accepted his invitation

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.030
and went to a distant brick kiln,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.440
which appeared to be nothing special.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.320
Destiny can't be controlled by humans,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.390
so I created a substitute for it.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.960
I call it

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.080
the Refining Furnace.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.780
[The Refining Furnace]

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.440
The Refining Furnace?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.870
What exactly is it?

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.440
I'm no expert

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.080
in divine crafts,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.320
but that thing

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.790
gives off a strange vibe.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.320
When I stood before it,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.390
I felt something intense

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.270
as if

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.030
it were judging me.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.390
Liu Dang,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.670
I've told you everything you need to know.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.360
Are you going to wait

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.120
or accept?

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.510
Chief Ma,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.030
I accept.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.030
They look pretty serious.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.600
Does it really have such power?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.750
Go.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080
Chief Ma,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.200
this won't end up ruining him, will it?

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.750
It's merely a work in progress.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.480
There's still a long way to go before turning it

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.600
into the perfect Refining Furnace.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.150
But

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.440
it's enough for Liu Dang

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.960
to get what he wants.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.400
To be honest,

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.240
although I saw quite a few strange things,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.720
at that time,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.110
I didn't believe a single word

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.160
of what Ma Xianhong said.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.640
That was until I saw him

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.550
walk out of the furnace again.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.830
It's completely different from the state he was in

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.240
when he fought me earlier.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.400
Is this the power of the Refining Furnace?

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.640
I could clearly feel

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.640
the qi from him.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.000
I never expected the Refining Furnace

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.590
to turn an ordinary person

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.000
with no sense of qi

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.200
into an Outsider.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.720
Now, I think I understand

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.880
why so many ordinary people

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.790
in this village

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.240
follow Ma Xianhong.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.720
They hope

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.000
he can use the Refining Furnace

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.000
to transform them into Outsiders.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.000
An ordinary person can be granted qi

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.440
without any cultivation.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.350
Wouldn't that throw the world into chaos?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.000
Where is this Refining Furnace?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.030
Can you take us there and show it to us?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.200
Sadly, I can't.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.960
Truth be told,

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.790
I was looking for that Refining Furnace

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.160
when I ran into you guys.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.720
I spent the whole day going up and down the mountain trail,

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.200
but it was all for nothing.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.830
It was nowhere to be found.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.510
Here we go with those mechanisms again.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.350
If it were just ordinary mechanisms,

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.750
that would be easy to handle.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.550
But this technique

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.270
is one of the Eight Supremes,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.680
the pinnacle of divine crafts,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.510
the Divine Forge.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.440
No need to worry about Liu Dang,

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.200
I've already sent him back to rest.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.000
Let me raise a glass to you two.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.480
I

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.920
am not much of a drinker.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.680
No pressure.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.830
Since you've entered the village,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.720
I've talked too much about myself.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.480
What I really want

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.240
is for you to get to know this village better.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.110
The Refining Furnace you've seen

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.240
and those puppets Ruhua

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.720
are all my inventions.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.400
This is the Divine Forge.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:46.750
Of course,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.110
it's nothing particularly remarkable.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.550
If you two are willing to stay and help,

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.830
not only will you be able to use

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.270
all the inventions here,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.310
but I'll also entrust

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.830
the Divine Forge to you.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.720
If you want it,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.240
that is.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.270
Chief Ma,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.200
you're way too generous.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.160
This is one of the Eight Supremes,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.350
a technique that all Outsiders in the world long to obtain.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.590
Yet you'd give it away just like that?

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.200
Techniques may be fixed,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.640
but people can be flexible.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.480
If I can exchange the Divine Forge

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.830
for your help,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.240
I'd be getting quite a bargain.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.200
So why wouldn't I?

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.270
How about this?

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.000
We'll give it some thought

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.590
and get back to you tomorrow.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.480
I could tell that Ma Xianhong

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.440
had really had

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.590
an impact on Qing.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.110
So I tried to take Qing away

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.000
that very night.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.110
Even if we have to leave,

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.400
there's no need to do it in secret.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400
Stop dragging your feet,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.350
move faster.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.000
If these people decide to go to extremes,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.680
they'll dig a hole and bury both of us.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.680
Then no one will ever find us.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.510
Qing,

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:43.880
you're acting strange.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.550
I'm thinking

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.160
that the fact Chief Ma called us here

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.640
shows he probably noticed us

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.680
since the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.310
That's why I'm worried...

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.720
What are you worried about?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.400
Qing,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.200
Wang.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.030
Where are you going

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.310
at such a late hour?

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.550
So this is what you're worried about.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.720
You noticed them a while ago.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.240
Since he wants our help,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.400
why would he let us leave so easily?

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.000
Even if you don't plan to stay,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.480
you should have been upfront with me.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.590
Instead, you left without a word.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.720
What do you take me for?

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.240
Would you really let us go if we were upfront with you?

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.400
Whether you leave or not doesn't matter to me,

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.400
but my friends here

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.350
think that after your outstanding performance

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.240
at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.440
it would be a shame not to experience

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.880
your abilities firsthand

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.350
now that you are here.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.720
I knew you were up to no good.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.030
So fast.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.030
I've defined the Center.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.200
You two better watch out.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.310
The blade severed the wind?

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.070
Get down here!

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.000
Qing!

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.350
Darn it.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.200
I wasn't in the correct house.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.440
Forcefully using Boulder Toss at this level...

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.550
Qing,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.480
why are you doing this?

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.310
Don't turn around.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.880
Turning around means you're officially declaring war on me.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.680
To be honest,

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.070
I'm more interested

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.680
in how Wang Ye defeated you

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.030
at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.750
than your Wuhou Qimen.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.000
But I must clarify one thing:

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.790
I've never lied to you.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.830
I really want you to join us

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.960
and become part of this village.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.240
You'd have access

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.200
to my Divine Forge

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.400
and Wang Ye's Qimen Manipulation.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.920
Of course,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.030
you can always sit back and watch.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.590
Who knows? Maybe Wang Ye

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.590
will pull off a miracle and defeat us all.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.880
Is Qing under duress?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.270
I've restrained five of them already.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.350
I can't afford to drag this out any longer.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.440
I'll sort one out first!

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:13.920
[Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, Vermilion Bird]

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.540
[Gouchen, Taiyin, Six Matches, Teng Snake, Zhifu]

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.780
[Qinyin. Heavenly Stems: Xin, Jia, Ding. Earthly Branch: Wu]

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.100
[Jing, Kai]

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.790
Remarkable, truly remarkable.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.880
You've managed to restrain

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.590
six masters on your own.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.400
But it seems like you're already struggling.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.510
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.270
Qing!

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880
Get out of here quickly!

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.240
I'm already...

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.270
You're already at your limit, aren't you?

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.680
Wang,

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.750
who would have thought this would happen to you?

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.000
What are you doing?

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.240
Hurry up and leave!

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.510
Protection?

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.750
What is it?

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.350
Did you think for a moment

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.270
that I was going to attack you?

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.110
Wang,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.440
whether you find someone to save me

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.480
or avenge me,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.350
that's all for after you escape.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.920
You don't have to feel indebted to me.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.790
I quite like you, actually.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.960
Because you and I

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.960
are completely different kinds of people.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.880
You always think of others first

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.680
when you act.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.030
Xun aligns perfectly with me,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.030
and I don't even need to stand in the right house to unleash my full power.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:10.480
Don't!

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:12.820
[Gouchen, Zhifu]

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.140
[Six Matches, Nine Earths]

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.790
Qing!

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.030
Crimson Serpent!

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.680
Wang,

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.160
I

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.920
always put myself first

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.400
in everything I do

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.550
and every decision I make.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.680
Sorry, Qing.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.440
I guess I have to disappoint you.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.110
If things really get desperate,

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.400
I could leave you behind and run,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.880
but it's not that bad yet.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.680
Ma Xianhong,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.920
you've won.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.350
Let Qing leave,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.480
and I'll stay.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.200
I'll give you what you want.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.270
Don't worry, it's all legit.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.640
I'll teach you everything.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.880
Wang, you...

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.830
Wang Ye,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720
I didn't win.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.400
You did.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.590
Wang, you've gained

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.590
a loyal friend.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.110
Qing,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.310
you've earned the respect of everyone in Biyou Village.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.590
When I first called,

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.920
I told you

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.790
that your Qimen Manipulation is the true legacy,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.680
which is why I consider you one of my own.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.680
I won!

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.160
Those who lost

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.400
will foot the bill later.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.160
No way.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.350
This guy clearly has the face of a villain.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.880
I ended up losing money because of you.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.960
Ma Xianhong,

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.350
what exactly is your intention?

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.160
It's only when facing a crucial decision

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.790
that one's true nature shows.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.680
I need both of your help,

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.350
and I want to see your true character for myself.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.200
Especially you, Qing.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.510
You've really touched my heart.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.030
I still want you both to stay,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.830
but it seems like

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.310
you've never really liked me.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.000
That's fine though.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.350
I'd never force anyone.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.310
Feel free to leave

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.640
if you want to.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880
Just remember

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.920
that Biyou Village will always have a place for you.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.480
Forget it.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.920
Let's go, Qing.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.350
Qing?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.030
I'm exhausted.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:22.750
Wang,

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.200
I might rest here for a few more days.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.270
Qing,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.350
you should be able to tell, right?

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.750
Regardless of whether Ma Xianhong is good or evil,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.590
this is a place of trouble.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.920
He is...

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920
What he's like

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.680
and what he wants to do

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.960
doesn't concern me.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
As I've told you,

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.240
everything I do

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.350
and every decision I make

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.270
is based on my own interests.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.270
You know how stubborn Qing is.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.680
Once he decides on something,

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.590
nothing can change his mind.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.550
I was quite wary of that Chief Ma,

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.160
so I entered the phantasmagoria right away

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.480
to get a clearer picture.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.510
How could this be?

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.480
It's just like the time

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.000
when I asked Zhang Chulan at Wudang.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.640
But Ma Xianhong's situation

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.880
shouldn't be so serious.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.400
It just shouldn't.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.070
Chief Ma,

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.510
whatever you're trying to do,

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:20.960
stop now.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.310
You guys can go back first.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.000
I'll talk to Wang Ye for a bit.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.030
Wang Ye,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.830
what are you trying to say?

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.830
You're too arrogant and stubborn.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.440
Your goals are too ambitious,

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.790
and it will bring disaster to the Outsiders' world.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.960
You won't succeed.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.310
Those with determination

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.030
will eventually succeed.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.240
I'm not mocking you.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.400
If an arrogant person learns to see things clearly and accept their fate,

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.070
they may yet find happiness.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.310
I don't believe in fate.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.920
So it doesn't matter

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.550
even if it harms those around you?

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.720
Of course, it matters.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.270
That's why in Biyou Village, people come and go freely.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.480
But even if I'm the only one left,

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.480
I'll keep going.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.110
You're much like another person I've met.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.680
You are both caught in the eye of a massive storm.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.160
But you're also different.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.000
What you're after affects too many

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.070
and poses too great a danger.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.960
As for the other person,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.440
future is still unclear to me.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.680
If you don't stop,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.440
I'll end you

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.920
here today.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:32.960
Wang,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.590
that's enough.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.000
Stop trying to change other people's fate.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.240
You don't have the right.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.000
You're always welcome to come back.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.510
That's what happened.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.200
I didn't expect to see

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.960
this kind of change

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.190
in anyone

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.800
other than you,

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.070
but he's not you.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.840
Ma Xianhong

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.630
will either destroy himself

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:16.960
or

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.760
the world.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.670
His misguided sense of right and wrong

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.360
will only bring greater harm.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.590
He must be stopped,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.280
which is why I focused my investigation

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.480
on the Refining Furnace.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.510
Judging by how much importance Ma Xianhong places on it,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.670
that thing

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.960
is probably

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.630
the key to uncovering his secrets.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.590
Any results?

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.960
Nope.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.000
I'll be honest.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.030
I've been trying to find that thing.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.280
But this village is so strange

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.590
that I haven't found a single lead.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.320
Anyway,

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.190
I've said enough.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.480
I'm heading back now.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.710
But Lian,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.960
are you here

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.840
to take down Biyou Village?

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.880
If that's the case,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.320
count me in.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.840
Go back!

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.400
You shouldn't be here.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.550
I just want to have a chat with Chen Duo.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.360
I told you to go back.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.360
Chen Junyan, bite him.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.670
So you are called Chen Junyan?

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.760
That's a nice name.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360
Thank you.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.480
Was it you

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.710
who broke my protection on the bridge

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.590
a few days ago?

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.960
How could it be me?

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.150
It really wasn't.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:14.510
You think I'll believe you just because you say so?

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.670
Qiu,

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.230
didn't Chief Wang say not to provoke them?

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.440
Sirs,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.590
I really just want to talk to Chen Duo.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.000
Sir, you look quite capable,

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.110
there's no way

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.800
I can break your protection.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.320
Please rest assured.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.550
I won't cause any trouble.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.440
Let him in.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:38.630
Go ahead.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.400
I know

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.190
you're all sent by the company to deal with Chen Duo.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.630
But even you are here as well.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.630
Are you out of your mind?

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.840
I know I'm weak.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.400
Don't worry.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.150
I won't start any trouble.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.000
I didn't expect

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.510
even a Beast Tamer like him

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.590
to also get involved in this mess.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.760
A Beast Tamer?

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.440
Sounds like someone who can control animals.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.670
That's right.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.710
They use their qi to communicate with

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.800
and control animals.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.760
Since not many

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.280
are willing to train so hard

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.000
just to communicate with animals,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.960
people in this profession

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.110
are quite rare.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.670
Could this just be one of his tricks

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.590
instead of his true ability?

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.030
I doubt it.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.920
While those in this profession may seem pretty useless,

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.480
it's actually quite hard to train for.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.070
The fact that he has reached such a level,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.280
you could say it's pretty impressive.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.550
Impressive loser!

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.230
What are you doing here?

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.840
I'm really sorry.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.360
Ever since I brought you out of the Medicine Immortal Association,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.150
I've been so busy.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.230
So, I've had to inquire

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.230
about your situation through Liao.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.000
Could you tell me

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.710
what actually happened?

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.840
How

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.400
did Liao die?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Sis,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.510
I've brought back

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.000
the person you wanted.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.480
You did a great job.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.230
Are the people from the company already here?

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.190
They're here to find someone,

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.280
a girl named Chen Duo.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.110
But don't worry, sis.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.230
They won't be a threat in the village.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.360
Look, sis.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.280
What we've always wanted

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.150
is finally about to happen.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.280
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.670
Guan,

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.760
what were you pondering

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.440
while staying up all night?

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.280
I've finally figured

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.480
something out.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.590
Compared to Chen Duo,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.000
what the headquarters dreads the most

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.630
is the current situation,

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.070
the population cap.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.280
The population cap?

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.760
Do you know

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.280
how many people there are in the world?

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.510
Probably around eight billion.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.070
What about the Outsiders?

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.070
I'm not sure.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.440
Currently, the registered number

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.670
doesn't exceed eighty thousand.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.280
The unregistered ones

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.550
are a small minority.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.840
So, if we do the math,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.670
the ratio of Outsiders to ordinary people

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.480
is somewhere between one in ninety thousand and one in a hundred thousand.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.920
It sounds pretty balanced,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.960
but what's the upper limit

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.960
for the ratio

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.190
of Outsiders to ordinary people?

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.670
One in fifty thousand.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.960
That's the population ratio

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.360
widely accepted around the world after research.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.280
In other words,

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.230
that's the population cap.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:11.670
What happens

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.840
if the population cap

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.760
is exceeded?

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.960
The Outsiders are powerful individuals,

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.070
but few in number.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.510
Once their numbers

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.400
surpass the population cap,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.880
a crisis will occur.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.150
The chances

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.280
of ordinary people

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.760
encountering them will rise,

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.360
and chaos will follow.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.710
It seems that what Ma Xianhong intends to do

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.710
may very well push the population cap over the limit.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880
This Biyou Village

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.920
has taken in a large number of evil Outsiders,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.920
and Ma Xianhong has even used the Refining Furnace

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.710
to turn ordinary people into Outsiders.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.440
These illegal methods

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.710
disrupt the ecological balance of the Outsiders' world

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.510
and will lead to irreversible disasters.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.760
Looks like Wang was right last night.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.110
Ma Xianhong

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.800
is arrogant and stubborn.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.670
He has clearly gone down the path of evil.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.230
We must report to the headquarters soon.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.360
Sis,

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.230
only we

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.440
can truly treat everyone equally,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.880
give everyone superpowers,

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.710
break the so-called balance NDT Express upholds,

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.320
and free everyone from control.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.000
A world of unity will be achieved

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.000
and everything will be perfect.
