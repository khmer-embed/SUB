00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.847
Cut!

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:50.591
- Jeed. - Lights up.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.760
Jeed, wake up.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:03.600
Jeed, wake up, girl.

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:07.520
Jeed, it's time to go home.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.800
Jeed...

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.040
Jeed?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.040
Are you awake?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.000
Were you asleep or dead? Seriously?

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:27.240
You collapsed in the middle of shooting.

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:29.920
The whole crew had to carry you into the car.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:33.040
Look, Boom.

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:35.767
I finished filming a commercial at one in the morning.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360
I woke up at four in the morning to film this show.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.400
And it was an action sequence!

00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:44.520
With a schedule this packed, I'm lucky I'm still alive.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:49.040
Jeed, you're the woman of the hour!

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.120
You have a fitting session tomorrow too, remember?

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.296
- For "Love Destiny," right? - Yes.

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:01.840
Why are they remaking that show?

00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.991
Bella is still young enough to star too.

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:06.480
The show is still popular.

00:03:06.592 --> 00:03:08.040
And sponsors are paying.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:11.733
The network wants to establish you as the next Bella.

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:14.560
You got this role ahead of everyone on the roster!

00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.360
If now's not your time to shine, then when?

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:23.600
Who's the male lead?

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:25.280
It's Job.

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:28.760
Who's the director?

00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:30.480
It's Aunt Jaew!

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:31.880
Aunt Jaew herself?

00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:35.720
Wow! This is too good.

00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:43.160
Then I need to sleep. Please make sure I get up on time.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.720
Okay.

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.454
And also...

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:49.287
Your ironclad rules on the set.

00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:51.080
There must be a manicurist,

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.280
a masseuse,

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.160
and boba tea whenever you need it.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.720
Wow.

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.840
You have James & Jeed and Job & Jeed cups? You're the best.

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:19.160
A second, please.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.640
I'll have the Job & Jeed one. Thanks.

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:29.746
Job, give me a shot of you touching Jeed's shoulder

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:31.976
and holding her hand with your other hand.

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.640
Jeed!

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.720
Are you okay?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.080
Jeed!

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200
Did you sleep last night?

00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:04.320
I slept for a bit.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:05.800
I'm fine.

00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:20.640
Okay.

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:30.960
Is that a wrap for today?

00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:32.920
Not yet, Boom.

00:05:33.087 --> 00:05:35.800
She needs to change and practice rowing a boat.

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.000
Hey, does this Karaked need to row a boat?

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:48.360
The script changed. The director wanted to see her rowing in costume.

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:50.760
Jeed!

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.160
Are you okay?

00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:54.160
If you're not, just tell us!

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:55.294
Yeah!

00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:56.879
- Boom! - Yeah?

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.280
Boom, have you seen this news of Jeed?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.240
I see her news every day.

00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:02.344
They always have typos.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.600
I'm not talking about Story, Boom. Look at this.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.480
- Oh? - Look at the headline.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.615
- Should I send the link? - Send it to me now.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.629
- Tell her to see this. - Send it. I'll take it to her.

00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:14.880
Okay.

00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:18.400
Wait a second.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.663
Hello? Yes?

00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:25.520
(Is this Ms. Nittra Boonyajirakul?)

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.440
(I'm a DSI officer working in Special Case Unit.)

00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:32.520
What DSI are you talking about?

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:35.720
I failed my Thai and English classes, but I'm not stupid.

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:37.520
You're a scammer!

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:39.640
Are you kidding? What DSI was he talking about?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.263
(Actor J. Leads Ponzi Scheme.)

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.080
(Co-star Actress J. Speculated to be Involved.)

00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:49.863
What the heck is this?

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:55.216
Yes, Boom?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.154
Hey, I don't know anything!

00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:00.056
Also, James and I

00:07:00.137 --> 00:07:04.668
just promoted a show together. I'm not an investor in his BBQ place.

00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:08.760
On the opening day, I went to try it out and promote it. I know nothing.

00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:11.840
I shouldn't have been.

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:14.440
Okay. I understand.

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:16.840
Just calm down and listen to me.

00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:18.720
Take a deep breath.

00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:21.720
Get off the boat and talk to me. Now.

00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:23.920
Excuse me.

00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:28.800
We're here to film

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.200
"Oh My Heart."

00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:31.680
Where is Mam's set?

00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:34.680
This is Love Destiny's set.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.880
Mam's "Oh My Heart" is filming over there.

00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:50.320
Cops!

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.880
(Episode 1: RIP... To Another World)

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.585
Boonta.

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:48.120
Boonta.

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:50.840
Boonta.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480
Boonta.

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:08.200
Are you a new actor?

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:16.800
You're hot.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.080
What is this place?

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:45.000
I'm still alive, right?

00:09:50.383 --> 00:09:51.410
Who are you?

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:57.000
You were unconscious.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.560
So,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.800
are we still doing "fitting?"

00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:06.080
And

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:08.280
where am I right now?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.766
Mother saw you almost died.

00:10:11.847 --> 00:10:13.400
She sent you up here to rest.

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:17.480
Don't try to kill yourself by drowning again.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.520
Me?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.960
Kill myself?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.600
I was just shocked to see the police.

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:31.720
By the way, have they left?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.080
Why would you ask for Krom Pra Tamruat?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.720
It's Luang Krom Pra Nakornban that saved you.

00:10:44.273 --> 00:10:46.080
Do you mean Metropolitan Unit?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.320
DSI too?

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:52.040
Where is Boom right now?

00:10:52.514 --> 00:10:54.760
Who brought me here?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.400
Boonta surely has lost her mind.

00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:00.480
That's why she's speaking such nonsense.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.760
Who's Boonta?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.240
My name is Karaked.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.200
Karaked Kedsurang, the protagonist of this show.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.360
Have you never seen it?

00:11:21.103 --> 00:11:23.520
Mother said once Boonta wakes up,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.400
we're to dress her up.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.000
She's on auction tonight.

00:11:29.992 --> 00:11:32.920
I just drowned, and I have to work?

00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:34.480
The contract obligates you.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.960
You will work for what you're paid for tonight.

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:46.160
Is this a work contract or a slave contract?

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:48.520
Boom.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.400
She took a job carelessly again.

00:12:43.008 --> 00:12:44.054
What's that?

00:12:44.135 --> 00:12:46.268
Tamarind core. Rub it on your body.

00:12:46.372 --> 00:12:48.183
Your skin will glow.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.760
This is turmeric powder.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.200
Your skin will shine bright like gold.

00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:35.920
Foreign flower water.

00:13:36.096 --> 00:13:38.360
Your scent will be seductive.

00:13:49.343 --> 00:13:51.840
Makeup is done with Krajae Jan powder.

00:14:00.647 --> 00:14:02.943
Paint your lips with lychee paper.

00:14:17.063 --> 00:14:18.640
Are we done now?

00:14:18.854 --> 00:14:21.080
Not yet. You have to do a pit smoke too.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.440
Pit smoke?

00:14:22.783 --> 00:14:24.040
Why would I do that?

00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:27.960
They don't smell.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.560
What are you doing?

00:14:29.823 --> 00:14:31.240
Lamjeak was talking about

00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:33.320
sitting on a pit smoke

00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:38.080
with perfumed ingredients. You'll smell good outside and inside.

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:49.040
I have to

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.640
sit my lady parts on that hot coal?

00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:55.955
- No! - Boonta!

00:14:56.039 --> 00:14:58.680
- It's going to burn! - Sit down. Trust us.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.120
You're gorgeous.

00:16:32.304 --> 00:16:34.040
They're going to pay well.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.880
If you need me to do anything, give me a "briefing."

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.720
I'll just do my work and get the "job" done.

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:43.720
What are you saying?

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.400
That's not a human's language.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.880
She just drowned. That's why she's speaking nonsense.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.520
That's fine.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.320
Tonight, you won't get to speak much.

00:16:59.215 --> 00:17:00.640
Take her downstairs.

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:02.560
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.040
Today's script is short, huh?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.640
- Let's go, shall we? - Wait.

00:17:19.362 --> 00:17:21.191
Not done yet?

00:17:51.431 --> 00:17:53.000
This place is not for you, sirs.

00:17:53.975 --> 00:17:56.320
Does Fang's brothel discriminate against guests?

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.160
Don't be rude to my guests, Ming.

00:17:59.383 --> 00:18:00.560
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:02.335 --> 00:18:06.000
My Courtesan House welcomes all guests.

00:18:08.294 --> 00:18:12.101
Are you here to auction for Boonta tonight, sir?

00:18:15.744 --> 00:18:17.400
Everyone visits this place.

00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:19.840
You don't have to be undercover.

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:26.000
- Chor, take good care of our Luang. - Yes, ma'am.

00:18:34.757 --> 00:18:36.240
Fang is something.

00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:37.887
We're here undercover,

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:39.752
yet she still recognized us.

00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:50.760
That Captain is really here.

00:18:57.304 --> 00:18:58.600
This way, sir.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.360
Please sit here, sir.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.720
Please.

00:19:14.232 --> 00:19:15.320
Ming.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.880
Officers like to spy here for information.

00:19:21.136 --> 00:19:23.880
Captain Jam is a hothead and always picks fights.

00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:26.111
Watch them. Don't let a fight happen.

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:29.640
I don't want chaos during Boonta's auction.

00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:31.680
Yes, Mother.

00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:44.280
That Captain was here for trading half a year ago.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.559
He went around buying stuff from the locals.

00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:48.560
He was arrested last time

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.160
and disappeared.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.360
He just came back not long ago, sir.

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.160
Keep an eye on him.

00:19:56.615 --> 00:19:59.400
If he's an undercover spy,

00:19:59.727 --> 00:20:00.960
we can nip it in the bud.

00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:02.160
Yes, sir.

00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:12.640
That's infuriating!

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.040
My clerk took three days off!

00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:18.360
I couldn't load my shipment without government approval.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.240
Is that why you hurt him?

00:20:22.063 --> 00:20:26.240
You know violence can cause trouble.

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.080
He abandoned his job!

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.080
Luang Thukkarat won't punish him either.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.840
He even threatened to arrest me

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.960
for violence against a Siamese.

00:20:37.553 --> 00:20:39.160
Those lowly officers...

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.680
They make a living out of people's trouble.

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:47.960
Siam has the best and cheapest sugar.

00:20:48.104 --> 00:20:50.040
It's a shame the government holds a monopoly!

00:20:50.623 --> 00:20:54.280
Just wait until Britain wages war on them as they did in Inn-Wa!

00:20:55.471 --> 00:20:57.960
The rumors of European invasion

00:20:58.199 --> 00:20:59.640
seem to be true, sir.

00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:09.760
"Setting" is right.

00:21:10.032 --> 00:21:11.200
The "extra" is.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.760
They sure went all out.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.600
Our Mother is generous.

00:21:14.704 --> 00:21:18.920
Otherwise, we won't be the most famous Courtesan House in Sampheng.

00:21:19.702 --> 00:21:22.320
So is this a whorehouse?

00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:25.462
Is this a remake or a new show?

00:21:25.558 --> 00:21:28.799
Why is Kedsurang in a brothel?

00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:30.399
Cool.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.360
The one on auction tonight is here.

00:22:10.719 --> 00:22:14.120
(All dressed up, get your moves up.)

00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:17.520
(Want to have fun, just come at once.)

00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:20.040
(If you want to play, dance this way.)

00:22:20.971 --> 00:22:23.122
(If you want to play, dance this way.)

00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:30.120
(My good sir, where are you going?)

00:22:30.232 --> 00:22:33.720
(Stay here a while, relax your mind.)

00:22:33.848 --> 00:22:37.246
(Betel or tobacco, I'll provide you.)

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.630
(If you want a good drink, it's in the jar.)

00:22:40.738 --> 00:22:43.080
(Oh, handsome one. Would you like to try it?)

00:22:44.008 --> 00:22:46.160
(Oh, handsome one. Would you like to try it?)

00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:53.104
(Boys to the left, men to the right.)

00:22:53.185 --> 00:22:56.670
(See the ladies, all gorgeous and nice.)

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.160
(Whether Luang or Khun, they all come.)

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:02.200
(Whether Luang or Khun, they all come.)

00:23:05.808 --> 00:23:09.215
(If you like one, call her in.)

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.680
(Pick a nice lady to please you. We won't disobey.)

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.406
(Like what you see? Give us the money.)

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.960
(You will receive your satisfaction.)

00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:21.761
(You will receive your satisfaction.)

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.000
Stop!

00:24:47.672 --> 00:24:51.280
I think we should start the auction right away.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.160
Let's start at

00:24:54.495 --> 00:24:56.040
one baht, sirs!

00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:58.240
- Two baht. - Two baht.

00:24:58.867 --> 00:25:00.960
- Three baht. - Three baht.

00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:03.360
Boonta sure is gorgeous.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.960
She's going to make a lot of money for Mother.

00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:10.400
She won't beat the price my first night was auctioned for.

00:25:10.702 --> 00:25:12.063
One tamleung.

00:25:12.383 --> 00:25:16.120
You think no one's going to pay three tamleung for Boonta.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.920
Three tamleung.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.440
Three tamleung.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.680
"Oh my gosh!"

00:25:28.503 --> 00:25:31.200
- Five tamleung. - Five tamleung!

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.800
Is anyone willing to pay more than five tamleung?

00:25:44.496 --> 00:25:50.320
If not, tonight, Boonta belongs to Captain Jam.

00:25:55.447 --> 00:25:56.487
Ming.

00:25:56.672 --> 00:25:58.880
Take Boonta upstairs to prepare.

00:25:59.272 --> 00:26:00.320
Yes, ma'am.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.880
- Come on. - Oh?

00:26:02.584 --> 00:26:04.440
- No "cut" yet? - Just come!

00:26:05.199 --> 00:26:06.520
What's wrong?

00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:09.631
- Are we leaving already? - So expensive!

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.640
Leaving now would be a waste.

00:26:21.272 --> 00:26:22.400
Luang!

00:26:27.903 --> 00:26:29.360
- Come here. - Hey, man!

00:26:29.503 --> 00:26:32.080
You didn't have to drag me so hard.

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:34.400
You're too harsh.

00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:36.520
- Get in! - Hey!

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.600
Wait here.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.640
You have to service the guest tonight.

00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:54.080
- Luang? - Silence.

00:26:54.294 --> 00:26:58.240
What service? That was a "one take" shot!

00:26:58.534 --> 00:27:00.360
That's a wrap. I'm going home.

00:27:01.124 --> 00:27:02.600
You!

00:27:03.478 --> 00:27:05.080
What are you talking about?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.880
When that Captain comes,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.680
you can sleep through the night. Mother Fang won't mind.

00:27:21.232 --> 00:27:23.680
Hey, don't I get a "briefing?"

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:26.512
What's this "scene?"

00:27:30.928 --> 00:27:32.248
Good evening.

00:27:43.343 --> 00:27:44.640
Shall we begin?

00:27:48.528 --> 00:27:50.600
Where's the camera? Hey.

00:27:52.002 --> 00:27:53.080
Man!

00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:54.960
I said we needed a camera.

00:27:55.776 --> 00:27:58.080
What's wrong? "You! Hey, stop!"

00:27:58.184 --> 00:28:00.600
"Not okay! Go!" Do you "understand?"

00:28:00.943 --> 00:28:02.640
You can speak our language?

00:28:02.775 --> 00:28:04.760
Oh, you can speak Thai?

00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:07.320
Stop! I'm not doing this scene! Let go!

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.090
You like it hard, don't you?

00:28:15.176 --> 00:28:16.280
Fine by me.

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:19.400
You're crazy!

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.400
I said stop!

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.179
It's Captain Jam.

00:28:27.342 --> 00:28:29.520
He likes to hit women before bed.

00:28:40.175 --> 00:28:41.360
"Darn it!"

00:28:42.607 --> 00:28:43.680
You vile thing!

00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:46.270
You're the vile thing! This is not a filming shoot anymore!

00:28:46.382 --> 00:28:47.780
What is this place?

00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:50.120
Is this not Nong Khaem?

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.240
I'll break your balls!

00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:23.560
New actor?

00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:27.000
Is this a dream or something?

00:29:29.312 --> 00:29:30.760
What does this have to do with you?

00:29:31.577 --> 00:29:32.960
Even if she's a courtesan,

00:29:33.262 --> 00:29:34.880
you shouldn't force yourself on her.

00:29:35.663 --> 00:29:37.188
I bought her.

00:29:37.311 --> 00:29:40.000
What I do with her is none of your business.

00:29:41.143 --> 00:29:43.143
Mister, you have to help me.

00:29:53.314 --> 00:29:55.340
I'm not staying anymore.

00:30:00.315 --> 00:30:01.760
Sorry.

00:30:02.464 --> 00:30:04.360
Sorry.

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.880
Boonta! Are you running away again?

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:10.040
- Ma'am? - Ming, after her!

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.080
What the heck is this dream?

00:30:30.151 --> 00:30:31.920
If this place is not Nong Khaem

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.840
and not Sampheng,

00:30:34.216 --> 00:30:36.160
- what is this place? - Boonta!

00:30:42.103 --> 00:30:43.320
After her!

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.160
Oh?

00:30:55.197 --> 00:30:56.480
Boonta!

00:30:57.016 --> 00:30:58.280
Move it!

00:31:46.808 --> 00:31:47.960
Are you awake?

00:31:51.511 --> 00:31:52.640
You again?

00:31:52.784 --> 00:31:54.160
Who are you?

00:31:57.264 --> 00:31:58.960
You really don't remember me?

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.760
He's Luang Thukkarat.

00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:05.680
What Rat?

00:32:07.716 --> 00:32:09.716
Too long. Do you have a nickname?

00:32:10.936 --> 00:32:12.320
My name is Chaai.

00:32:12.735 --> 00:32:13.920
Chaai.

00:32:15.903 --> 00:32:19.320
My name is Yod. I serve as his representative.

00:32:20.207 --> 00:32:21.600
Do you mean a lawyer?

00:32:21.831 --> 00:32:24.320
You look too young to have graduated.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.960
You're too good.

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.640
You ran away and collapsed last night.

00:32:33.647 --> 00:32:35.080
Do you remember?

00:32:38.576 --> 00:32:39.800
Last night?

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.920
So you saved me and brought me here?

00:32:50.647 --> 00:32:51.920
This is my house.

00:32:54.567 --> 00:32:56.920
Where exactly is your "my house?"

00:33:03.943 --> 00:33:05.640
It's on the Chao Phraya riverside.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.720
Po Seng port.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.480
So

00:33:21.456 --> 00:33:26.040
Where are Oriental, Peninsula, and Icon?

00:33:27.952 --> 00:33:29.640
What B.E. year is this?

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320
B.E.?

00:33:33.727 --> 00:33:36.320
Buddhist Era. What year is this?

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.000
You don't remember even what year it is?

00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:43.040
It's the year of the Rooster.

00:33:43.727 --> 00:33:46.120
Minor Era 1187.

00:33:47.072 --> 00:33:49.680
1187 M.E.?

00:33:51.532 --> 00:33:52.880
So,

00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:54.480
which reign is this?

00:33:55.503 --> 00:33:56.760
Why are you asking for rain?

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.040
Not rain.

00:33:58.143 --> 00:34:00.760
I mean, the reign of King Rama I, II, or III?

00:34:00.863 --> 00:34:02.863
Who's the king?

00:34:03.783 --> 00:34:05.560
If you mean the reign,

00:34:05.968 --> 00:34:07.840
we're under the third reign now.

00:34:08.288 --> 00:34:10.280
Before this, there was the early reign,

00:34:10.439 --> 00:34:11.720
then the middle reign.

00:34:14.743 --> 00:34:16.480
The third reign?

00:34:21.572 --> 00:34:24.520
So, I've come back to King Rama III's era?

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.600
"Oh my god!"

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.400
Luang, sir!

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.640
Ming is here for Boonta.

00:34:32.752 --> 00:34:35.960
He said Fang demanded her back right now.

00:34:43.037 --> 00:34:45.000
How could you do this, sir?

00:34:45.288 --> 00:34:47.120
Captain Jam won the auction for Boonta,

00:34:47.223 --> 00:34:48.880
yet you kidnapped her to bed with her.

00:34:48.984 --> 00:34:50.600
This is damaging to me.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.360
Did you see me taking Boonta from your place?

00:34:55.471 --> 00:34:59.840
Chor said you picked her up and stayed in the room next to Boonta's.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.800
And then you left her suddenly.

00:35:01.896 --> 00:35:04.160
Captain Jam is also demanding that I pay for the damage

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.120
because you fought him in his room.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.640
I saw that Captain physically assaulted Boonta, so I intervened.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.000
I saw Boonta running out and collapsing.

00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:13.600
How could I have left her be?

00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:16.240
You should have brought her back here, not to your home.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.560
Boonta is my property.

00:35:19.373 --> 00:35:21.840
I told you I'm not Boonta.

00:35:22.326 --> 00:35:24.326
And I don't want to stay here.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.357
I know my beauty can do "damage,"

00:35:28.943 --> 00:35:30.560
but I don't want to be a prostitute.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.440
I don't want to be like Kankaew. And

00:35:34.363 --> 00:35:38.240
who's the other one? Renu!

00:35:42.315 --> 00:35:46.640
Mister, I don't want to stay here. I don't want to be in a brothel.

00:35:46.919 --> 00:35:52.040
I promise I won't live off of your money. I'll pay you back every dime.

00:35:53.127 --> 00:35:54.840
You've helped me once.

00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:57.660
Please free me from this place.

00:36:06.607 --> 00:36:08.080
Boonta was paid for

00:36:08.631 --> 00:36:10.280
at five tamleung, is that right?

00:36:10.448 --> 00:36:11.920
It's ten tamleung now.

00:36:13.016 --> 00:36:14.440
Don't try to lie to me!

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.920
We all heard last night. It was five tamleung.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.600
The price has gone up as of today.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.560
Will you pay for her then, sir?

00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:28.440
I'm a person, not a dog! How can you tie me up like this?

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.480
You're lucky to just be tied.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.920
Captain Jam

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.640
demanded I pay double for the damage.

00:36:33.744 --> 00:36:36.120
I actually want to kill you!

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.960
I just don't want to commit a sin before making merit.

00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:42.415
You sell humans for a living.

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.080
- You won't get any merit! - You!

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:47.360
Stop.

00:36:47.592 --> 00:36:49.240
I don't want to ruin her price.

00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:50.840
Hey, old hag.

00:36:50.968 --> 00:36:52.560
If you want to sell me,

00:36:52.703 --> 00:36:54.560
why didn't you sell me earlier?

00:36:56.465 --> 00:36:59.760
So you think he wanted you as a wife?

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.600
He just took you home without paying a dime.

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:08.000
He's not generous enough to buy your freedom!

00:37:10.543 --> 00:37:12.600
Ming, watch her.

00:37:12.743 --> 00:37:15.160
Make her hungry and thirsty until she gives in.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.360
- Yes, Mother. - No!

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.080
And if any of you

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.560
feed her behind me, I'll flog your back!

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.720
Leave her.

00:37:33.312 --> 00:37:34.720
Where are you going?

00:37:35.785 --> 00:37:37.520
Take this off me.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.760
Don't go!

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.200
Jamleak!

00:37:46.607 --> 00:37:48.736
Hey! Help me!

00:37:53.544 --> 00:37:55.840
So my role is really a whore?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.120
I'm Jeed Nittra.

00:37:58.288 --> 00:38:00.400
I must have a more important role.

00:38:00.743 --> 00:38:02.260
Like traveling back in time to defeat rebels.

00:38:02.264 --> 00:38:04.680
Stop Siam from being colonized or something.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.440
Other people come back in time as nobles.

00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:10.960
Of all things, why does heaven make me a whore?

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.680
A whore!

00:38:21.504 --> 00:38:22.525
Luang, sir.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.080
Boonta is tied in a banana bush out back.

00:38:27.216 --> 00:38:28.920
Would you let her be?

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.440
I tried negotiating for her

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.000
and got disrespected in return.

00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:36.840
Do you want me to just overpay?

00:38:44.383 --> 00:38:46.360
I'm actually feeling sorry for her.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.480
Ever since Boonta drowned,

00:38:49.911 --> 00:38:52.040
she hasn't been her old self.

00:38:57.944 --> 00:39:01.840
My name is Nittra, not Boonta!

00:39:02.737 --> 00:39:05.760
Why do I have to look like this Boonta?

00:39:05.896 --> 00:39:07.760
It's like Kasalong and Songpeeb.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.560
What did I do? Why do I have to meet that Luang?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.240
You sucker! You didn't help me at all!

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.520
How do I get home anyway?

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:17.760
Let me go!

00:39:18.935 --> 00:39:20.600
You can't go home.

00:39:22.136 --> 00:39:24.080
You've been sold to this place.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.920
- Drink this. - Water?

00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:41.520
- I'll feed you. - Thanks.

00:39:45.031 --> 00:39:46.480
Easy.

00:39:47.757 --> 00:39:49.000
More.

00:39:56.095 --> 00:39:57.640
This is all I can do for you.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.480
Thank you so much.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.080
You're

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.320
Jamleak, right?

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.680
Lamjeak.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.960
Sorry.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.400
You're friends with Boonta, right?

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.600
Then you must know what happened to Boonta.

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:22.080
You really didn't remember anything?

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.080
You don't even remember Luang Thukkarat?

00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:32.040
If Luang Thukkarat hadn't intervened,

00:40:32.295 --> 00:40:34.240
I would have had my way with that woman.

00:40:36.863 --> 00:40:38.440
What do you mean?

00:40:38.738 --> 00:40:40.160
That officer!

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.440
He went undercover as a guest at Fang's brothel.

00:40:45.656 --> 00:40:47.440
He took Boonta out of there.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.680
At least Fang paid me for the damage.

00:40:57.368 --> 00:40:58.600
Last night?

00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:01.720
You didn't bed with that courtesan, did you?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.480
You left, so you didn't know.

00:41:04.752 --> 00:41:06.000
That sly officer

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.120
interrupted my pleasure on purpose.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.760
He keeps bullying me at every turn!

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.840
I heard that

00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:17.680
the Luang was honest and decisive

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.800
and a fair man, wasn't he?

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:24.240
He's just a lowly officer obsessed with a courtesan.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.920
Rumor has it

00:41:27.103 --> 00:41:29.800
that Luang Thukkarat had feelings for Boonta,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.080
even before he arrested Bua, the one who sold you sugar,

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240
and put her in jail.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.720
It must be true.

00:41:38.928 --> 00:41:41.160
That's sugar, not drugs.

00:41:41.392 --> 00:41:42.720
Is it illegal?

00:41:43.055 --> 00:41:44.080
Yeah, it is.

00:41:44.183 --> 00:41:45.816
The government forbids independent sales.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.320
It must be sold through the Treasury.

00:41:47.944 --> 00:41:49.136
When your mother got arrested,

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.400
your family's wealth got confiscated.

00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:52.960
Your mother fell ill in jail,

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.720
so you had to borrow money to pay for her treatment.

00:41:57.088 --> 00:41:58.600
What a dramatic life.

00:41:59.182 --> 00:42:00.480
When your mother died...

00:42:02.433 --> 00:42:03.680
My mother died?

00:42:04.264 --> 00:42:06.000
You were sold to this place,

00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:09.079
but you didn't want to work, so you tried to kill yourself by drowning.

00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:11.240
I tried to kill myself?

00:42:12.087 --> 00:42:14.280
You were lucky that Luang saved you.

00:42:15.055 --> 00:42:16.200
Wait.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.280
The one responsible for me being a prostitute

00:42:19.464 --> 00:42:21.800
was the one who saved my life?

00:42:23.224 --> 00:42:24.560
How is that possible?

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.560
Your life is ruined, and you're in debt because of him.

00:42:31.047 --> 00:42:33.480
The only way to pay off your debts is to work until you die.

00:42:38.176 --> 00:42:39.400
Die?

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.320
That's right.

00:42:44.247 --> 00:42:45.480
I need to die!

00:42:56.183 --> 00:42:58.440
Ming, ask Muen Hor

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.120
if he'd finish repairing my roof today.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.840
He's been doing it for a while.

00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:04.800
- Yes, ma'am. - Mother!

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.920
Lamduan ran away again.

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:08.520
So this girl won't obey, huh?

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.160
Drag her back here. I'll flog her back off!

00:43:11.527 --> 00:43:12.880
Mother!

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.368
Mother! It's Boonta...

00:43:15.449 --> 00:43:17.808
Whoa! What does she do this time?

00:43:22.128 --> 00:43:23.128
Oh my!

00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:25.271
Untie her now! Don't let her die here.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.480
Yes, ma'am!

00:43:30.414 --> 00:43:32.320
Quick! She's going to die!

00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.760
Boonta!

00:43:38.819 --> 00:43:41.000
Boonta! Stop!

00:43:46.136 --> 00:43:48.960
Boonta! You did it again!

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.840
Whoa! These shorts...

00:44:15.713 --> 00:44:17.160
(I'm sorry, Lamjeak.)

00:44:17.264 --> 00:44:19.264
(Even if I don't know why I'm here yet, )

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:21.480
(I don't want to stay.)

00:44:21.888 --> 00:44:23.400
(I need to go back.)

00:44:23.512 --> 00:44:25.840
(The only way to go back is)

00:44:26.145 --> 00:44:27.320
(water.)

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.160
Of all boats, why did it have to be this horny Farang?

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:30.992
Am I cursed or something?

00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:33.560
You sure are good at running.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.536
Your "Mother" is probably looking for you.

00:45:36.686 --> 00:45:39.000
I'll bring you back home.

00:45:39.504 --> 00:45:40.760
No!

00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:42.120
Let go!

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.400
I'm not going, please.

00:45:57.767 --> 00:45:58.800
No!

00:46:01.512 --> 00:46:02.800
You again!

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.320
Are you going to interfere with everything I do?

00:46:05.746 --> 00:46:06.746
You...

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.840
Let me go.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.760
Don't tell me you two have conflicts before this?

00:46:13.216 --> 00:46:14.440
Before last night,

00:46:14.593 --> 00:46:17.840
he ruled in favor of Captain Jam's clerk, whom he beat up.

00:46:19.838 --> 00:46:21.838
Was my decision on your case

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.880
that much of a grievance to you?

00:46:25.568 --> 00:46:27.240
I was just doing my job.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.240
Your job is

00:46:29.392 --> 00:46:31.392
to take your people's side

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.960
even if he was lazy and incompetent?

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.840
It's probably true that

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.440
trading in Siam is difficult,

00:46:39.648 --> 00:46:42.240
and you have to keep one eye closed.

00:46:42.559 --> 00:46:46.840
That's because Siamese are lazy, corrupt, and sly!

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.440
Whether it's a merchant, a clerk, or an officer!

00:46:52.966 --> 00:46:55.200
So it's been this way since this era?

00:46:55.828 --> 00:46:58.480
You're indeed Thai police.

00:47:00.759 --> 00:47:01.759
It's no wonder

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.200
you took off work and followed a courtesan.

00:47:07.023 --> 00:47:08.640
Watch your language, Captain!

00:47:09.582 --> 00:47:10.880
A Luang and a Captain

00:47:10.968 --> 00:47:14.520
are fighting over one of my courtesans in front of my place?

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.600
It seems I must hike up Boonta's price further.

00:47:22.304 --> 00:47:25.160
How about one chang?

00:47:26.063 --> 00:47:27.520
Hey, old hag!

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.400
I'm not seducing men to "up" my price.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.320
I'm not going with anyone.

00:47:32.445 --> 00:47:33.445
Are you crazy?

00:47:33.528 --> 00:47:35.040
What are you saying?

00:47:35.191 --> 00:47:36.191
You've lost your mind.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.240
Ming, take her inside.

00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:39.520
Yes, Mother.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.760
Come here! Now!

00:47:42.597 --> 00:47:44.320
Come here! Come with me!

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.480
If either of you wants to see Boonta,

00:47:51.656 --> 00:47:53.656
please come to my place.

00:47:54.031 --> 00:47:56.640
I'm going to auction her off again.

00:47:59.679 --> 00:48:01.280
It's such a good opportunity.

00:48:02.016 --> 00:48:03.440
How can I miss it?

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.240
She's serious.

00:48:16.856 --> 00:48:18.760
Her slap is harder than Ann Thongprasom's.

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.080
Don't worry. I won't ruin your gorgeous face.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.680
That's your tool to make a living.

00:48:34.429 --> 00:48:37.000
If you dare run away again,

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.680
you won't just be tied up.

00:48:42.872 --> 00:48:44.320
You'll be killed.

00:48:53.743 --> 00:48:55.040
Lock her inside.

00:48:55.429 --> 00:48:56.588
Yes, ma'am.

00:49:40.224 --> 00:49:42.480
Why does this happen to me?

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.240
Boonta?

00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:23.200
Boonta!

00:50:24.152 --> 00:50:25.640
Boonta is burning up.

00:50:27.677 --> 00:50:29.120
Hey, anyone outside?

00:50:29.232 --> 00:50:30.895
Help! Boonta is burning up.

00:50:37.697 --> 00:50:39.560
Hey, watch out!

00:50:39.856 --> 00:50:41.600
You're going to ruin my stuff.

00:50:44.489 --> 00:50:46.049
Trading with the Siamese,

00:50:46.217 --> 00:50:48.320
there's so much formality.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.640
You know, Captain,

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.480
whenever a European ship comes ashore,

00:50:53.664 --> 00:50:55.200
Treasury must inspect the goods

00:50:55.312 --> 00:50:57.200
and pick out what we need.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.856
Once we have sufficient goods,

00:50:58.999 --> 00:51:00.640
you can sell the rest.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.480
Today, I have to visit Fang's brothel.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.560
It would be good if you hurry up, Clerk.

00:51:08.272 --> 00:51:10.360
I'm afraid you won't be leaving anytime soon.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.320
Luang Vasuthep.

00:51:24.263 --> 00:51:25.535
I heard that

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.440
your ship carries forbidden items.

00:51:28.735 --> 00:51:29.760
That's not true.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.640
My ship only carries the goods to sell to the people of Siam.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.840
Whether your word is true or not,

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.240
we'll see.

00:51:38.475 --> 00:51:39.696
Search the whole ship!

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.680
Luang Thukkarat sent you to stall me, did he not?

00:51:47.423 --> 00:51:48.800
What are you talking about?

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.120
I don't understand.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.720
You're a close friend of Luang Thukkarat.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.680
You two know well

00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:59.360
that tonight, I'll go for Boonta at Fang's brothel.

00:52:00.487 --> 00:52:03.120
That's why you're stalling me here on purpose.

00:52:04.463 --> 00:52:06.280
I'll complain about this to Pra Nakhonban

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.600
and say Luang Thukkarat

00:52:07.688 --> 00:52:09.200
abuses his authority.

00:52:10.328 --> 00:52:11.960
Watch your language, Captain.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.720
Our duty is to work for the King.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.240
We keep peace and order in our land.

00:52:20.608 --> 00:52:23.040
If anything could threaten our peace,

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.680
we have to investigate.

00:52:26.304 --> 00:52:30.360
You bully me because you see me as a foreigner, is that it?

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.480
I'll complain to the Resident of Singapore

00:52:33.719 --> 00:52:35.880
that Siamese are unfair.

00:52:37.799 --> 00:52:39.000
Unfair?

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.080
Let me warn you, Captain.

00:52:42.135 --> 00:52:43.640
Don't you ever think I don't know

00:52:43.832 --> 00:52:45.600
what you once said.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.240
If the Europeans wage war against us,

00:52:50.415 --> 00:52:53.080
as they did in Inn-Wa, as you said,

00:52:54.055 --> 00:52:56.920
and if I inform the King of this,

00:52:58.335 --> 00:53:00.120
you probably know

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.800
what would happen.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.760
Luang Thukkarat went undercover at Fang's brothel

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.160
to find out about that, right?

00:53:22.575 --> 00:53:24.960
If she wakes up today,

00:53:25.447 --> 00:53:26.800
she'll make it.

00:53:27.447 --> 00:53:29.120
If she still has a high fever,

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.440
give her a towel bath.

00:53:31.936 --> 00:53:34.360
I'll prepare some medicine for you.

00:53:34.824 --> 00:53:36.000
Thanks.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.240
Boonta, are you awake?

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.320
You're lucky.

00:54:04.178 --> 00:54:05.840
What's wrong with me?

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.840
You burned up and slept for two days straight.

00:54:09.152 --> 00:54:10.760
Would it kill you

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.600
to spend a day locked in?

00:54:13.255 --> 00:54:15.880
If you get flogged, wouldn't you die at the first strike?

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.160
Pudsorn!

00:54:22.247 --> 00:54:23.320
Look.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.760
If a person dies that easily, I've died long ago.

00:54:27.436 --> 00:54:29.120
Now that you're not dead,

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.680
just get up and do your job.

00:54:33.623 --> 00:54:36.680
Tonight, you will bed with Captain Jam.

00:54:38.879 --> 00:54:40.800
(I was a lead actress over there.)

00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:43.111
(Why did I become a whore here?)

00:54:47.601 --> 00:54:49.960
(Guest Starring: Thatchaphol Kuwongbundit)

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.400
Where is Captain Jam?

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.000
If he doesn't come, I'll sell Boonta to someone else.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.280
You're old enough to get married.

00:55:03.479 --> 00:55:06.160
I want to see you settled down.

00:55:06.328 --> 00:55:08.080
Say good morning to your man.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.640
- Fang's brothel. - My master is leaving.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.040
Wipe her feet and put on her shoes.

00:55:16.168 --> 00:55:17.800
Why don't you do it yourself?

00:55:18.087 --> 00:55:22.200
Smart mouth! You've been a courtesan for a few days, yet you got cocky!

00:55:22.399 --> 00:55:24.640
Take off your sash and wipe her feet with it!

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.600
If you call yourself a noble with that behavior

00:55:27.936 --> 00:55:29.120
and that kind of manners,

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.600
I'd rather be a whore.

00:55:30.815 --> 00:55:32.528
You don't have to service our guests anymore.

00:55:32.552 --> 00:55:34.400
All I did was stand up for myself,

00:55:34.551 --> 00:55:36.520
and you rewarded me, Mother?

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.560
Someone bought your freedom.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.320
Someone bought Boonta?

00:55:40.432 --> 00:55:42.800
You're too late, sir.
