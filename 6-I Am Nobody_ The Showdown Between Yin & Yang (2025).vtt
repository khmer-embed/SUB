00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.200
Unbelievable.

She undoubtedly possesses cognitive awareness.

The operation of the poison technique

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.600
is highly complex.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.600
The fact that she can endure such potent poison

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.720
with only her body demonstrates that,

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.320
in some ways,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.750
her strength exceeds our imagination.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:20.960
The Medicine Immortal Association

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.440
has constantly trained her,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.600
aiming to suppress her responses to stimuli.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.750
So, you're suggesting that with the right stimulus,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.720
we might bring back her human side?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.030
In theory, yes.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.360
We were hoping this would lead us

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.550
to a way to cure her.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.120
But we've tried

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.390
every possible stimulus,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.910
and she hasn't responded.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.440
At this point,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.870
we have to consider long-term plans.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.670

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.910

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.600
and have set a baseline.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.390
Any stimulus in her daily life

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.630
that causes the fluctuations

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.320

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.910

You know,

you'd never fail?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.240
Well, all it takes is one failure,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.390
even if it's on purpose.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.630
That alone would break the cycle.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.550
That's out of the question.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.030

would make them sick.

Then, I ran into the Big Monster

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.820
and ended up peeing myself again.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.470
But over time,

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.470
I found that the people here

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.510
aren't too bad.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.910
Being stuck here is annoying,

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.540
especially with that scar-faced guy around.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.060
He bullies everyone,

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.860
but he can't do anything to kids,

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.270
so we get to bully him instead.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.750
I don't know

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.990
why you're here

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:13.990
but

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.910
don't worry.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.710
They'll handle

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.430
the rest.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.510
This is a safe place.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.510
Bring Chen Junyan out.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.540
Got it.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.270
Let's go.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.980
[78 bpm. 80 bpm one minute ago]

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.430
It's slowing down again.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.540
Shall we give

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.470
another stimulating approach a shot?

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.540
It might work.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.670
No.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.910
We've worked hard to get here,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.140
and if we pick the wrong stimulus,

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.710
it'll cause her to regress.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.860
Gather all her data,

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.380
I need to submit it to the board

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.710
for approval

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.230
of the next steps.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.060
I really didn't expect the board

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.230
to approve your proposal.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.380
It certainly wasn't easy.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.580
There was a lot of debate,

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.750
but in the end,

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.190
they agreed with me.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.620
Are we all set?

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.140
Don't worry.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.100
All participants are of high caliber.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.470
We've informed their families

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.540
about the associated risks

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.710
and necessary details.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.300
Our top experts

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.270
are stationed around,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:20.540
so everything's under control.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.510
Monks should practice the restraint of anger.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.540
Hit it.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.140
Attention everyone.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.060
If you detect

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060
any possibility

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.430
of a deadly poison leak,

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.860
restrain the Poison Girl immediately

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.750
and stop all operations.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.430
The priority

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.270
is ensuring

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.380
the participants' safety.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.710
This will teach you a lesson.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.380
You two seem perfect for each other.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.910
You want a lesson too?

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:18.780
Miss,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.100
are you also here to save someone?

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.340
What's your name?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.140
Your hair is so beautiful.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:24.780
It looks amazing.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.470
Miss, you're so pretty.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.510
This will serve you right.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.910
You fool. How can you hit me for real?

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.820
Did you get hurt?

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.270
Get up now.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.540
Are you okay?

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.100
Are they bullying you?

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.540
Swallowing saliva.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.710
Directly into the dantian.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.910
Are you okay?

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.750
Miss, are you all right?

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.470
Are you sick?

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.670
Miss, are you okay?

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.380
Miss, are you okay?

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.030
Is it serious?

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.340
Miss, are you okay?

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.140
Miss, are you okay?

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.950
Miss, are you okay?

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.580
Is it serious?

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.380
That will do.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.340
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.710
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.580
What are you expecting?

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.860
The familiar abuse?

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.860
Compared to that kind of pain,

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.620
this inexplicable existence

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.430
has left you more at a loss, right?

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.300
Sorry,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.750
I can't give you back the world

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.270
you were anticipating.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.710
Even if you don't know

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.230
how to put it into words or explain it,

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.750
you can feel it deep down, can't you?

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.030
The one who's abnormal

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.230
is you.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.340
It's been an hour.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.710
Is everything all right?

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.910
The research institute has been studying

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.380
the poison in this girl.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.750
There have been some findings,

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.990
but they're not ideal.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.780
It's not so much a poison

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.860
but more like qi.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.270
Qi is the source

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.430
of all life.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.300
In the body of an outsider,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.670
qi takes shape and has substance.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.990
Qi transforms into form,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.190
and from form, life emerges.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.510
Life is just the aggregation of qi.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.710
Everything is born from the laws of nature.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.270
Yet this girl's qi

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:21.990
is formless,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.780
as though it comes from nothingness

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.060
and returns to it.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.270
Or perhaps

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.990
she's from another world,

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.340
where cause and effect don't exist.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.950
Quit trying to sound smart.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.230
Just speak in simple terms.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.270
What I mean

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.270
is that it's a bad result.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.710
As long as her organs are still functioning,

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.620
the poison

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.510
will keep producing itself.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.750
Right now, it seems

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.820
almost impossible to cure her.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.230
Face.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.580
Face.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.990
Face.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.340
Face.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.140
Face.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:23.780
Yes.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:24.750
Next.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.100
Blue.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.380
Blue.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.300
Blue.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:35.910
That's right.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:36.620
Blue.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.140
Come on.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.030
Here we go.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.620
How come you're not tired?

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.030
Dude,

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.540
you've got to win at least once.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.620
Look at yourself.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.230
You keep shouting until your voice cracks,

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.710
but you still can't beat her.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.990
Don't talk as if it's a simple thing.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.820
Her stamina is beyond human.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.230
Even you're probably no match for her.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.230
Good news.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.750
You can go home now.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.910
Go home?

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.620
Go for the rebound!

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.030
Why don't you brainwash me

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.100
and then send me back?

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.190
Just like in the TV shows,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.990
organizations like yours

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.430
always erase the victim's memories

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.670
of being persecuted.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.780
You must have a way of doing that, right?

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.190
We don't.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.670
You brought me here,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.340
and it's like entering a whole new world.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.030
With all this talk of qi

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.270
and superpowers,

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.820
my whole worldview

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.710
has been upended.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.060
And now, you want me

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.710
to go back to the normal world?

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.780
That's your problem.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.710
That's right,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.710
Poison Girl.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.230
This is cheating.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.300
What Poison Girl?

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.230
It's Chen Duo,

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.670
as in the flower "Duo."

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:05.710
I came up with the name.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.620
She'll take my last name.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.100
From now on, call her Chen Duo.

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:09.220
Got it?

00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:16.540
My name is Chen Duo.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.620
Right.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.620
You're absolutely right.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.870
It was my oversight.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.310
But I'm the one who chooses names.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.510
After all, I'm known as the god of names!

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.390
We can choose names like Li and Mi.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.260
Sir,

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.220
calm down.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.180
You!

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.950
Your face...

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:43.620
Amazing, right?

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.100
The antidote is working.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.220
Time to go.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.260
What are you looking at?

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.870
Where is the beautiful lady going?

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.260
She's about to leave.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.180
I should have asked her earlier

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.950
how she ended up here.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.100
Cut it out.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.700
You just want her phone number.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.660
True,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.140
I was planning to ask her out.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.580
Let's stop bickering.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.580
I'll also be leaving in a couple of days.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.140
Make sure to come visit me afterward.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.310
Mr. Zhao,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.220
can we not delay this a little longer?

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.470
We really can't delay this any longer, Liao.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:57.030
Mr. Zhao,

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.390
with Chen Junyan being someone who can wield

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.030
Outsiders' technique without relying on the flow of qi,

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.700
do you understand

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.430
how precious a case he is to us?

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.950
Some people just have special skills.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:07.470
If he doesn't have the qi flowing in him,

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.580
then Chen Junyan can't really

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.140
be considered an Outsider.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.390
According to their explanation,

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.540
the anomalies in him

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.910
were caused

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:14.790
by a third type of contact.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.660
You know?

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.350
This isn't even in our field of expertise.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.140
If it weren't for Chen Junyan,

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.870
I wouldn't even believe

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.220
such a department exists.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.740
Check out the text above.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.660
[Profanity is strictly prohibited in the workplace.]

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.220
How come you're still swearing?

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:30.790
Before anything else,

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.060
copy the text above

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.700

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:34.700
A hundred times?

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.180
Do it now.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:49.910
Bye, Big Monster.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.580
Chen Junyan,

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.470
will you be leaving as well?

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.430
Of course.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.140
I can't stay here forever, can I?

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.180
Once I'm cured,

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.180
I'll leave too.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.870
Are you unwell?

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.100
They all say I'm an alien,

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.060
not able to adapt to Earth's environment.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.140
I guess everyone who stays here

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.700
is unwell in some way, right?

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.100
So,

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.790
what will you do when you go out?

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.260
Not sure,

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.990
I'll decide once I'm out.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:55.580
Chen Junyan,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.510
you're getting worse at this.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.740
I've been beaten by you so many times,

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.030
I've gotten used to it.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.870
I'll admit it,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.430
you're a bit better than me.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.310
Just a bit though.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.310
Chen Duo,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:16.870
if I leave,

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:18.430
will you miss me?

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:24.870
I don't know.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.310
Are you leaving?

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.180
They're going to take me somewhere else.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.470
They say I don't have qi,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.620
so I'm not considered an Outsider.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.430
They won't let me stay here anymore.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.910
But no matter where I go,

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.580
we'll always be friends,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.540
right?

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.220

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.180

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.830
- Time to go, brat. - Chen Duo.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.510
Chen Duo!

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:17.950
Mr. Liao,

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.700
can you get Chen Duo

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.350
a phone or something?

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:21.950
Look at you, acting so pathetic.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.220
Unlike you, Chen Duo is calm.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.740
We've already sorted everything out for you over there.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.740
You're free now.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.580
Chen Duo!

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.390
Chen Duo!

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.390
Chen Duo!

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.540
Put me down, Mr. Liao.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.910
Chen Duo, don't forget me!

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.220
Chen Duo!

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.790

Don't forget me!

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:23.220
Mr. Liao,

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.030
can I go out now?

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.100
It's getting late.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.310
You should get some rest.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.310
Am I also someone

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.990
who doesn't belong here?

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.700
If she had caused

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.950
a serious incident, it would have been simpler.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.100
She would just stay locked up.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.100
But now, neither locking her up

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.390
nor freeing her seems right.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.060
This is the first time I've encountered such a situation.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.950
Also,

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.870
I'm concerned about her condition.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.100
Her physiological indicators

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.620
are becoming more stable,

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.100
which makes me fear

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:36.470
she could regress.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.350
Do everything you can to heal her body.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.100
We can't give up.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.700
Also, find one of our top experts

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.910
to train her.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.350
Liao,

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:46.350
what are you up to?

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.180
Didn't you also undergo training before?

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.220
So train with her for a couple of days.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:52.990

Don't worry,

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.100
I won't go all out.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.430
But make sure

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.700
to protect yourself

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.060
