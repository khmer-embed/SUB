00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.680
Qing,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.950
I took the liberty of inviting you over

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.760
to ask you for some help.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.040
Come on.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.840
I'll take you a for visit.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.200
OK.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.200
Great.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.840
Qing,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.480
"Ten Qimen Practitioners and nine are crazy."

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.840
Is it true?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.070
Yes.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.400
The challenges of phantasmagoria are extraordinary.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.790
Not everyone can handle it freely.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.590
Then what happens if someone who isn't skilled enough

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.280
enters the phantasmagoria?

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.070
The phantasmagoria turns the heart

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.230
into presentation.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.560
Beginners will experience

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.230
an indescribable pleasure.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.000
All your wishes are coming true.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.350
You are capable of anything.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.870
You can't bear to give up that kind of pleasure.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640
But probably you are losing yourself

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.870
in reality.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.560
Is there any way to control it?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.840
Well, I am taking a further exploration

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.070
at the deep secret of the phantasmagoria.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.360
But I don't have a suitable way or approach.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.870
Qing,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.750
if only

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.310
you came to this village earlier.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.680
Okay, we're almost there.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.870
What do you think

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240
of the Furnace?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560
Pretty awesome.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.910
So do you want to try

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.470
using this Furnace?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.910
This is Ms. Zhao

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.710
and this is her son.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.750
Chief Ma,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.910
he is...

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
His name is Zhao Nian.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.800
He used to be an office worker.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.910
He practiced some Qimen Skills

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.280
he picked up from somewhere.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.910
Then he's like this.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.120
Another ordinary man

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.520
who wants to be an Outsider.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.960
You can say that.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.430
But unfortunately,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.310
he took the wrong path.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.680
His mother

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.080
came to Biyou Village

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.560
to wake him up

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.750
with the help of the Refining Furnace.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.560
I didn't want to bother you.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.910
But I'm not good at phantasmagoria.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.960
Zhao Nian's vital signs

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.310
are increasingly unstable these days.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.630
Therefore,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.430
I have no choice but to ask for your help.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Mr. Zhuge,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.590
Chief Ma said

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.840
you could save my son.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.080
Please!

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.190
Please help us.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.630
Please get up, Ms. Zhao.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.190
Mr. Zhuge,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.470
please!

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.910
Please!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.120
Save him or not.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.080
It's up to you.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.240
Okay.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.400
I've been wanting to try the Furnace for a long time.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.520
What should I do?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.710
Qing, I knew

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.240
you would help them.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.430
In fact, I've done a lot of efforts

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.680
with the Refining Furnace

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.080
before you came.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.680
I tried to rebuild the human meridian vessel

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.240
in the Refining Furnace.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.150
It's useless.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.590
There's no problem

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.720
with the running of their meridian vessel.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.720
They are just lost

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.600
in their own consciousness.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.430
But let's take another perspective.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.070
The phantasmagoria is built from the meridian vessel.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.480
With the help of the Furnace,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.600
you can integrate your meridian vessel

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600
with Zhao Nian's,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.510
so that...

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.630
We can share the phantasmagoria.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.510
Right.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.800
That’s why I need your help, Qing.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.870
Interesting.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.510
I know what to do.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.920
Tell me how to operate it.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.600
The Refining Furnace will get everything ready for you.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.600
All you need to do

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.870
is bring Zhao Nian out.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.000
Qing,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.000
you will enter not only his phantasmagoria

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.160
but also your own.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.040
I don't know what is going to happen.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.630
The more you say it,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.000
the more interested I am.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.630
Bring it on.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.190
Stop wasting time.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.040
A fairyland.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.390
Amazing.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.510
But the visual effect is too...

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.750
There are so many people.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.750
Which one is Zhao Nian?

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.310
What a grand welcome ceremony!

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.160
Surrender!

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.190
Surrender?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.510
I won't.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.680
Does any of you

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.070
dare to be the enemy of me, the Number One Saint of the Three Realms.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.630
You take away my magic weapon.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.870
I'm going to kill your whole family.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.870
I took your magic weapon.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.390
Take it back

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.360
if you are capable.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.310
Seven stars break the sky.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.950
Whoever stands in my way,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.800
no matter which God,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.360
even heaven,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.720
will be...

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.750
Sir!

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.270
Your highness,

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.830
may I know your name?

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.160
Nicholas

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.120
Zhao

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.160
Yunshang

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.750
Nian.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.070
Who are you?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.750
He even changed his surname!

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.510
Shut up!

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.000
My surname

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.630
has been here for thousands of years.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.430
How can someone like you slander it?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.950
Qing,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.270
Why did you come out?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.360
Mr. Zhuge,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.630
how is my son?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.920
I think

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.390
he is quite happy now.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.310
We don't need to help him.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.510
He's fine.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.070
Stop kidding, Qing.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.480
Even you can't do anything?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.830
Mr. Zhuge,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.040
just say a number

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.510
and I'll give the money to you.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.920
That's not what I meant, Ms. Zhao.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.390
How to say it?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.190
It's not difficult

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.190
to take him back for his situation.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.800
But he may go back again at any time

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.070
after he wakes up.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.390
Chief Ma,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.070
can you erase

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.360
part of his memory

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.680
when he wakes up?

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.820
I can't.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.480
I was only asking.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.600
Why are you so serious?

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.680
Never mind.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.070
Let me try again.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.270
I'll have to do it my way

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.870
if it doesn't work this time.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.800
The phantasmagoria

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.040
is hidden in the weakest part of the deep consciousness.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.430
He can be influenced greatly

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.240
by what I do.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.800
Zhao Nian may be shattered by this.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.720
Is it okay, Ms. Zhao?

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.240
Please.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.790
Then I'll try again.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.840
It's you again

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.480
I just cut you into ashes.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.360
Are you

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.360
from the immortal Eastern Ghost Tribe

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.960
in the legend?

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.000
Your highness,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.270
I'm not some ghost.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.480
I'm here because of your mom.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.360
She asked me to take you home for dinner.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.670
My mother?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.030
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.240
My mother is trapped

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.200
in the Deceased Emperor Tower

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.320
for protecting me,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.790
the only blood of Taichu.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.840
Tell me,

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.360
what are you here for?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.550
I can't stand you anymore.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.480
In short,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.960
the happy life you are living

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.510
as an Immortal is fake.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.000
In reality,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you are just an ordinary office worker.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.360
Interesting.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.600
I'm becoming interested

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.480
in your background.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.790
Right.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.600
I had some weird dreams before.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.630
In my dreams,

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.750
I was ugly,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.150
humble,

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.720
and weak.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.910
In the dreams,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.150
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.480
However,

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.000
everyone else wanted to hurt me.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.030
Everyone else looked down on me.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.080
You are wrong.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.870
In fact, nobody looks down on you.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.200
They don't look at you at all.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.720
Everyone is busy.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.550
Why will they look at you?

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.550
Rubbish.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.000
I forgot to tell you

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.240
I am a sorcerer.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.120
The phantasmagoria

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.080
is my home court.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.080
You took my hit without vomiting blood.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.720
The level of your martial arts

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.550
is at least the Advanced Stage of Crazy.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.000
You are an advanced stage! Your whole family is an advanced stage!

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.360
I didn't want to do this.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.600
But the only way

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.320
to stop you from wallowing here

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.720
is to defeat you completely

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.910
in your deep consciousness.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.790
Now

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.510
are you going back with me?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.320
Defeat me

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.390
completely?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.840
You know nothing.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.390
Built with three thousand Great Taoists,

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.510
The second of the three world-destroying demon swords,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.750
Sky Cutting Sword!

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.080
Chief Ma,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440
is everything okay?

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.720
How so?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.910
It's the first time it reacts like this.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.840
Is it Zhuge Qing's Ji

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.120
that causes components overloading which triggers the vibrations?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.510
Cut the sky?

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.870
Why do you always want

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.510
to cut the sky?

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.840
The voice

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.320
isn't from that man.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.790
Tell me,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.360
did the sky provoke you?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.030
Why do you want to cut it?

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.510
Who are you?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.000
Me?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.750
I'm you in the real world.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.000
Now way.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.910
You are a monster.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.480
Monster!

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.390
I can destroy heaven and earth.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.870
I can break the void.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.150
Why can't you kill me?

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.080
It's simple.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.790
Because everything you are experiencing now

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.550
is all an illusion.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120
And the dreams

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.840
you don't want to remember

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.720
are real.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.550
Who do you think you are?

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.550
Why should you define what is real?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.960
Do you think you are God?

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.030
To be right,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.550
even God

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.240
has no right of defining reality.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.840
And I

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.200
just defined

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.080
that this world is just an illusion.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.960
Illusion?

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.600
The air,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.440
earth

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.670
and the knife in my hand,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.720
I am feeling them.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.030
Why should you

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.270
define what they are?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.030
Feeling?

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.000
If feelings can be taken for real,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.870
there won't be so many people in the world

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.870
practicing hard.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.440
Are you seeing it?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.080
Feelings are unreliable.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.790
If feelings mean the reality

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.150
then your reality

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.360
can be twisted by a few pills.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.000
You said this world is unreal.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.480
Is the world in the dreams you talked about

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.670
is real?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.200
Yes.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.510
Because it's more reasonable.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.870
It's unreasonable to be able to defeat countless masters with one blow

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.390
You have no strength.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.670
You are yelled by your boss and don't dare to look up. That's more reasonable.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.550
So it's more real there.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.150
Tao is reality.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.870
Reason is reality.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.720
Evidence of that world being real

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.440
is in your memory.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.150
Everything in this world

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.440
originates from there.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.030
I don’t want that kind of reality.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.120
I don't care

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.960
about reality

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.600
or illusion

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.200
as long as I am powerful.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.360
Powerful?

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.270
Do you mean

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:46.960
this?

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.120
Chief Ma,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.390
what's happening?

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.750
No.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.960
The components are not acting right.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.150
Qing,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.440
you need to hurry up.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.000
I don't know

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.440
how much longer the Furnace will hold.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.790
Look,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.600
I shattered your world with one kick.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.270
Is it powerful?

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.960
I don't think.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.200
Because I don't see any reason

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.910
from the kick.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.510
And you can't imagine the hardship I went through

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.750
when I was practicing?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.910
Reason...

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.840
So many reasons...

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.480
You are so annoying.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.840
So what if it's unreasonable

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.320
when I can experience

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.120
the pleasure of being powerful?

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.150
The thing is that powerful people are reasonable.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.120
No matter boxing,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.150
mathematics,

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.240
or physics,

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.510
the people

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.320
become powerful

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.670
on the way of exploring truth.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.720
This is by no means an easy way.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.630
Think about it if you don't believe me.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.480
In the dreams you don’t want to mention,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.120
aren't you

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.440
walking on that way too?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.600
What else can you do?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.510
Do it again!

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.600
Which one is more real?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.480
Which one is more powerful?

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.030
The God who wants to cut the sky

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.550
or the nerd that studied all night?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.350
Yunshang Nian

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.000
is much better than the trashy Zhao Nian, right?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.790
Shut up!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.550
Oh no.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.350
I have to stop the Furnace first.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.480
Mom!

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.720
My son!

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.400
Mom!

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.680
I'm a coward.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.240
I'm useless.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.510
So let’s talk about the most important thing

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.200
since you are awake completely.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.070
Do you know

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.550
why you were trapped in that situation?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.240
You rode with lax reins?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.030
Do you know the concept of "monkey's heart, horse's will"?

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.270
This phrase is from a classic book in Han Dynasty.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.310
Journey to the West also used this concept.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.240
I don't have to explain

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.480
the meaning of it.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.310
An ancient Practitioners once had an interpretation.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.110
They compared the monkey

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.400
to Sun Wukong,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.830
and the horse to the White Dragon Horse.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.590
Follow the heart.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.880
Defeat the evil.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.510
The monkey's heart jumps around.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.750
The horse runs everywhere.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.830
If you can't keep your heart,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.240
it's easy to lose yourself

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:02.880
and get into trouble.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.350
This is the so-called "Ride with lax reins,

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.400
doomed to disaster."

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.720
This is how an ancient practitioner

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.000
understand Journey to the West.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.830
Of course he could be wrong.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.350
But one thing was right.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.510
Even from a modern person's perspective,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.830
we should stay true to our heart,

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.640
have a strong mind

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.550
and a strong body.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.000
That's the real Practice.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.030
You went crazy this time

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.110
because you were taken over

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.440
by your feelings.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.240
I'll ask you another question.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.440
What's the name of Sanzang's horse?

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.480
White Dragon Horse.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.270
Another identity of the horse

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.270
is the Third Dragon Prince of the West Sea.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.720
Here's a pretty simple riddle.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.000
Interpret the Third Dragon Prince of the West Sea.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.200
The West...

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.110
The West...

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880
The Third Dragon Prince...

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.880
The third Qian of Yao...

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.070
Right.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.030
That's the last thing I want to tell you.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.440
I won't interfere you

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.880
no matter where you go or what you do.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.640
But I hope you remember it.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.830
I will.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.790
I will remember it forever.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.350
The third Qian:

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.680
A man should work hard during daytime.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.240
Be vigilant even at night.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.830
Then he's doing it right.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:24.260
[The third Qian: A man should work hard during daytime. Be vigilant even at night. Then he's doing it right.]

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.000
Thank Chief Ma.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.830
He saved you.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.880
Thank you.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.070
Don't thank me.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.480
The Refining Furnace and Mr. Zhuge saved you.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.880
It's not easy to be an Outsider.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.920
Go back.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.680
Remember

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.640
Biyou Village will always welcome you.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.590
Zhuge Qing.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960
Zhuge Qing.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.720
Who is that?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.350
Qing?

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.510
He really entered my phantasmagoria.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.750
But I didn't have any thoughts.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.920
Wouldn't the phantasmagoria exist

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.720
if you don't think about it?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.510
Who do you think you are?

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.590
The man you woke up

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.640
didn't hurt anyone.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.400
He just wanted a place to be peaceful

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.750
where he can accept himself.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.640
Why wouldn't you let him do it?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.480
Meanwhile,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.720
you keep talking about truth and reasons

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.680
but never

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.680
dare to admit what you want.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.070
You don’t even dare to admit your own desires.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.310
He hid in the phantasmagoria.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.880
You are hiding in Biyou Village.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.510
How are you smarter than him?

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.240
Shut up!

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.310
I just said the truth to you and you can't stand it.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.640
Isn't it your own choice?

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.160
Do you really think that Ma Xianhong

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.480
called you here

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.350
just to save

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.160
an unimportant office worker.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.350
You have already figured out

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.790
that Ma Xianhong was taking advantage of you.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.440
But you still accepted it

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.000
because you wanted to see the Refining Furnace.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.240
Do you know

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.680
what changes you will bring to the world?

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.000
Shut up!

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.510
You made a mistake

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.000
and it's irretrievable.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Zhuge Qing,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.110
you lost.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.590
You lost completely.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.400
I told you to shut up!

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.720
Qing?

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.720
Qing?

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.240
Qing?

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.480
What's wrong, Qing?

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.980
I'm fine.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.270
Maybe a little tired.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.830
Chief Ma,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.640

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.920
Good it is ruined.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.160
As long as you don't care.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.510
I'll go back then.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.790
How could I not care?

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.880
Qing,

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.830
do me a favor.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.480
Stay for a while.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.830
What are you doing with Chief Ma recently?

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.550
You are being mysterious.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.000
He asked me

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.480
to do him a favor.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.270
Have you finished?

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.240
I guess so.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.240
What’s wrong with you?

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.070
I'm trapped.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.200

for many, many years.

What is it?

An old rival.

I have to face it.

It's a battle of life and death.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.640
Don't you understand?

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.160
Nonsense!

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.550
Who mastered all the skills of Four Pillars

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.960
of Heaven, Earth, Human and God

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.720
in less than seven years?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.350
It's us.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.110
He learned it half way

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.240
and still masters it.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.030
Will we, who have great talent,

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.830
be hurt by it?

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.310
You are indeed awesome.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.720
No.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.200
Just like what you say about Wang.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.510
The skill you crave for is indeed awesome.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.160
The temptation is too big. I can't win.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.640
Challenging you

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.550
is in fact a gambling.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.790
I'm betting the final legacy

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.240
of Wuhou Sect on it,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.030
Samadhi True Fire.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.790
You want to use

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.030
the thing you can't even master

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.030
to fight with me.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.640
Light it up.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.680
Light it up to me if you can.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.310
You piece of trash from Wuhou Sect.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.270
I'll give you two options.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.400
Either

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.960
I kill you here

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:33.750
or

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.350
you study Divine Forge with me.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.510
I surrender.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.440
I'm a piece of trash.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.400
I choose the second option.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.480
You should have been this smart earlier.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.020
[Divine Forge]

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.240
How can it be?

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.110
That's impossible.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.200
We didn't succeed when we did it together.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.590
How can you do it alone?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.960
So that's it.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.680
Fortune and misfortune depend on each other.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.270
The Eight Supremes are too terrifying.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.350
So there isn't extra fear

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.270
for the Samadhi True Fire.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.030
You have become a slave to Divine Forge.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.160
And I

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.440
am liberated.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.200
You lit the Samadhi True Fire only by chance.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.110
Does it make you forget who you are?

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.310
Can you control it

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.160
with your ability?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.750
Can you really control it?

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.790
Do you really think you can get rid of me?

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.920
Even if you can control it,

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.350
can you burn me

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.070
when I can roam around the phantasmagoria?

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.550
Come on!

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.030
Burn me

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.640
if you can.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.880
Did you forget

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.510
what the Samadhi True Fire is for?

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.920
With spirit of the upper Elixir,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.720
Qi of the middle Elixir,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.310
Essence of the lower Elixir,

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.240
Light up the fire of life

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.510
with energy.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.510
The fire does not burn wood,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.350
The fire does not burn earth or stone,

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.960
The fire only burns the souls of everything in the world.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.790
Samadhi True Fire,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.200
Break!

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.070
Zhuge Qing!

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.830
Anyway, I've always wanted

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.750
to burn up this place.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.230
Thank you

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.630
for guarding me.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.150
You did it, Zhuge Qing.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.070
I did it.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480
I did it.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.000
I asked Chen Duo

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.800
about

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.510
what happened

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.230
and how

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.230
Liao died?

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.400
[Five years ago]

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.550
Let's start

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.360
from the operation to exterminate Medicine Immortal Association

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.840
five years ago.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.920
Are you okay?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.190
The poison concentration here is too high.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.280
The suit can't protect us

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.510
if we stay here any longer.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.550
We need to get out of here immediately.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.880
We won't find any more survivors.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.070
Look around.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.070
Even serpents and scorpions

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:46.360
can't survive in the environment

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.070
let alone people.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.710
Send a request to the headquarter.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.590
Let's get out of here.

Come here.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.280
Take care of him.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.670
Everyone, take your things

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.800
and leave here immediately.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:58.360
Hurry!
