00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.000
A village banquet?

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.440
We'll think about it.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.440
We'll head off now.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.110
Don't mention these people

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.240
to anyone else in the village.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.680
Just keep an eye on them for me,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.960
but don't cause any trouble.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.440
Their target is Chen Duo,

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.070
so as long as they don't make a move on her,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.790
leave them alone.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.720
There are two updates.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.750
The good news is that Ma Xianhong has admitted

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.240
that Chen Duo is in the village.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.440
The bad news is

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.830
that he'll never hand her over.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.400
If we take action,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.510
both he and the entire Biyou Village

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.310
will become our enemies.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.440
Their power

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.440
has far exceeded our expectations,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.440
especially since Ma Xianhong

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.160
is the successor of Divine Forge.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.400
No wonder the Outsiders we've been fighting

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.070
have so many powerful magic weapons.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.440
It turns out this village is home

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.440
to the heir of the Eight Supremes.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.550
This trip has been worth it.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.110
I've always wanted to see

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.030
the Eight Supremes which caused the Jiashen Calamity.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.200
Once we're done with Chen Duo,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.830
I'll pay Chief Ma a proper visit.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.480
Are the Eight Supremes

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.200
truly as formidable as the rumors suggest?

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.070
Aren't you also an heir of the Eight Supremes?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.640
He is the real deal.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.350
The legend of the Eight Supremes

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.160
must have been exaggerated.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.030
Still, we shouldn't take it lightly.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.440
Here's the thing.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.920
The Eight Supremes aren't as formidable as they're made out to be,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.880
and the situation isn't as bad as it looks.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.790
As long as we don't harm Chen Duo,

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.640
we can stay in the village.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.270
Here's the plan.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.510
I'll handle the village banquet

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.310
and keep a close eye on Ma Xianhong.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.440
As for the rest of you,

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.440
feel free to roam around the village

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.480
and gather as much information as you can.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.440
Here I come!

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.110
What

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.920
are these pigs doing?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.160
Why are they acting so crazy?

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.920
You guys don't castrate pigs here?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.240
If they're not castrated,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.310
they won't fatten up

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.640
when they're in heat.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.110
I see what you mean,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.680
but we don't have the expertise.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.790
Yeah.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.000
Cut!

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.030
This pig's language

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.070
is so filthy.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.030
What's it saying?

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.030
It's saying it hurts.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:44.920
Cut!

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.750
Young lady,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.240
did you also come to this village

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.830
to seek the village chief's assistance

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.920
in gaining stronger abilities?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.510
No,

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.790
I'm already quite strong.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.590
So, you're a master, too?

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.160
Do you possess any extraordinary powers or abilities?

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.110
I...

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.000
can eat more,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.790
sleep more,

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.510
and live longer than you all.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.160
Hello,

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.240
do you know this person?

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.350
No, I don't.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.000
Have you ever seen this person?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.640
I haven't.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.790
Why is the sun not moving at all?

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.420
[Biyou Village]

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.510
Good day, Chief.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.160
Good day, Chief.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.680
Good day, Chief.

[Welcome to Biyou Village]

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.030
Good day, Chief.

Come on, everyone,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.240
let's go to the village banquet with Chief Ma.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.240
Chief Ma, we want to raise a glass to you.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.200
Chief Ma,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.680
thank you for taking care of us.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.510
Every person here exudes a strong aura of qi.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.440
In this small Biyou Village,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.160
there are actually so many exceptional Outsiders.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.310
And it's never been recorded in the NDT Express system.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.830
How many other secrets

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.510
does this village hold?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.440
Chief Ma,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.680
could you explain to us

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.790
what the pursuit of formlessness is?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.070
Chief Ma,

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.590
go ahead and tell us about it.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.920
Yes, please explain it to us.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.200
Come on, have a seat.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.400
Do you remember the tale from ancient times

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.750
when the Outsiders defeated opposing generals and rose to power?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.000
I've heard it before.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.350
On the surface, the battle

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.720
seemed like a struggle for world supremacy,

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.790
but what were these Outsiders

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.240
truly fighting for?

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.200
It all stemmed from two sects of Outsiders

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.920
with differing views

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.920
on how their superpower should be passed down.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.030
The Outsiders of the Chan Sect believe

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.550
in following the will of heaven

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.200
and explaining the law of nature.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.070
They categorize all things into different ranks,

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.880
emphasizing the importance of teaching according to one's talents.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.640
Those of the Jie Sect, however,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.720
advocate the concept of fifty paths to Tao,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.310
and that fate can only be predicted in forty-nine of them.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.750
They believe that all beings have an unpredictable chance at life

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.480
and promote equality for all.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.640
They seek the way of formlessness.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.790
Their disciples are often beasts, birds, and other extraordinary creatures.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.000
Compared to the Chan Sect's self-proclaimed orthodoxy,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.240
where teachings are only passed on to the greatest,

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.640
I align more

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.160
with the Jie Sect's pursuit of formlessness.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.550
Look.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.310
Our lives

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.110
are like those puppets on the stage,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.920
lost in illusions.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.750
Others,

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.310
ourselves,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.680

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.480
life, and death

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.920
are all constantly pulling

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.510
and manipulating us.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.750
Gradually,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.920
we grow weaker

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.680
and numb,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.720
silently enduring

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.640
the manipulation of fate.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.110
We lose ourselves

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.070
and our control over our own destiny.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.310
Aren't you here

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.720
to break free from all of this?

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.200
Here in Biyou Village,

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.510
I hope everyone gets the chance

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.270
to realize their vision.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.680
I will help you,

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.880
and all the suffering

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.480
will cease to exist.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.030
This is all too bizarre.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.750
Ma Xianhong,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.270

mean to you?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.640
You've all been wandering around the village for quite some time.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.110
What have you discovered?

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.350
Share with us.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.550
I haven't discovered anything.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.640
I've discovered something.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.030
I now know the identities of the two pig castrators.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.310
One is Du Yongbo,

35 years old, an architect.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.720
The other is Zhang Jiang, 42 years old,

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.640
who runs an entertainment company.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.510
They're both ordinary people

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.000

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.110

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.720
This girl from the Northeast Region is interesting.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.510
She hasn't appeared

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.680
but knows everything about our progress.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.960
I'm with you on this.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:34.850
[Southwest Region]
Erzhuang,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.630
we won't be able to trust you unless you clearly explain

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.080
how you got this information.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.870
[Northeast Region]
What do you mean by that?

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.750
Not showing up at the start of the mission

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.110
was understandable.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.110
But we've come this far,

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.310
and there's still no face-to-face communication.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.480
I'm afraid I can't trust you.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.160
[Northeast Region]
Xiao, are you also ganging up on me

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.680
with them?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.000
I don't really mind

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.880
whether it's face-to-face or not,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.350
but simply throwing this info at us

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.640
is quite suspicious.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.730
[Northeast Region]
Do you think

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.420
being left out all alone feels good?

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.680
This is me. Feel free to take a look.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.310
I don't mind revealing my identity.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.750
I'm the daughter of the Northeast Region's Supervisor,

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.240
but you can just call me Erzhuang.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:31.750
I'm sorry.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.680
I don't mean to avoid you all.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.830
It's just that I don't even have

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.790
what it takes to sit with you all.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.070
My superpower allows me to observe and manipulate electromagnetic waves.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.550
I once trained under the Wuliu Sect

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.590
to master the Out-of-Body Technique.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.960
Back then, I was still whole.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.880
But an accident

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.880
left me like this.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.400
I never expected those two skills

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.350
would later become the means for my survival.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.680
Now, my consciousness can detach from my body

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.720
and exist as electromagnetic waves for extended periods.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.440
Perhaps it's fate,

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.240
a blessing wrapped in misfortune.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.750
By controlling electromagnetic waves,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.270
I can join your conversations.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.790
Erzhuang,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.920
we've misunderstood you.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.350
It's all right.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.000
I feel much lighter after telling you the truth.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.680
Now, you can understand

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.920
why I was able to gather

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.550
all the villagers' details so quickly, right?

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.160
The moment someone turns on their phone,

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.510
they're like an open book to me.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.350
[Southwest Region]
So, are we also an open book to you?

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.710
[Northeast Region]
You can relax.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.070
I do have some professional integrity.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.920
I didn't check your phones.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:44.880
Are you sure?

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.070
Okay.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.790
I'm heading back to my body to rest.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.200
You can handle the rest.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.590
Hang on.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.000
[Northeast Region]
You guys are so annoying.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.040
I feel like crying,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.440
but without a body, how can I cry?

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.090
It's so frustrating!

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.000
This guy's in the village, too?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.000
Zhuge Qing.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.840
Do you know each other?

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.070
We're not particularly close.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:45.920
This player...

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.710
This guy

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.000
is secretly dating

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.030
one of Chief Ma's subordinates.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.630
Even the way they chat is so intimate.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.320
I even have their chat history on hand.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.780
I miss you so much. Can I come to see you?

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.610
Stop it. Didn't we just meet?

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.310
But I don't want to be apart from you for even a second.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.070
I really want to post our photo.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.280
Please don't!

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.760
We can't let Chief Ma know about us, okay?

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.190
Bao,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.030
give him a call

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.190
and check what's going on.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.710
Hello, please stay on the line.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.710
The number you have dialed...

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.070
He doesn't answer the phone,

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.110
and he doesn't reply to messages either.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.630
Looks like he's guilty.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.590
We haven't even asked anything yet.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.670
I've found

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.400
a familiar face here too.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.110
[Qiu Rang]

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.280
Isn't this the guy

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.800
who saved Chen Duo that day?

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.400
Qiu Rang?

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.710
The situation in this village appears

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.670
to be even more complicated than I had anticipated.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.760
Based on the information gathered by Erzhuang,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.510
the people in this village

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:48.400
can be roughly divided into three categories.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.550
The first category is the most ordinary villagers,

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.510
like the two people I met

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.150
when I was castrating pigs.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.320
They are the most ordinary people

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.550
and don't pose any threat to us.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.230
They are too weak to fight.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.320
The second category is the early-stage Outsiders.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.510
They have a lot of magic weapons,

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.880
like the ones who fought you in the warehouse

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.510
and injured Xia Liuqing.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.550
These Outsiders have superpower

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.070
that don't match their combat experience.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.480
Their origins are somewhat strange,

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.280
but they aren't too hard to handle

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.030
in actual combat.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.510
The third category

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:06.510
is the Outsiders who have been in the village the longest

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:07.710
and are closest to Ma Xianhong.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.440
According to the information,

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.280
each of them has skills

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.510
similar to that of Qiu Rang.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:11.440
They are a little harder to deal with,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.510
but we can launch sneak attacks

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.800
and take them down one by one.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.630
Is there anything you want to add?

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.510
Impressive, Bao.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.710
Bao's analysis is spot on.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.000
This village has taken in

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.400
a lot of Outsiders on the run.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.710
Take a look at this file

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.670
on a girl named Fu Rong.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.150
[Fu Rong]
She looks clean and refined,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.920
with a good job

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.030
and education.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.920
She was even a disciple of a renowned swordsmanship master.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.800
But when you keep scrolling down,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.000
that's when things get interesting.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.670
Zhang Chulan,

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.590
looks like your player...

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.070
friend

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.670
has hit the jackpot.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.760
Xiao,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.230
why are you smiling?

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.710
Did you find something?

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.480
This Zhao Guizhen

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.110
is quite interesting.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.710
Guys,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.440
I'll call dibs on him first.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.510
This person doesn't have any criminal record.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.000
Xiao,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.880
do you know him?

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.230
I don't.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.760
Zhang,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.550
can you tell me

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.070
your first impression on this person?

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.230
He looks righteous,

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.150
quite serious,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.840
and even a bit rigid.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.320
How about now?

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.280
Can you still see righteousness in his eyes?

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.630
Sometimes,

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.590
people can be judged by their appearance.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.510
A person's true nature is hidden

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.800
in the subtleties of their facial expressions,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.670
which need to be broken down and carefully analyzed.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.800
Take Heiguan, for instance.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.150
At first glance, he appears

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.030
to be just a rugged middle-aged man,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.280
with clear signs of age

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.480
marked on his face.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.670
His habit of raising his eyebrows

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.510
creates wrinkles,

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.760
and the long-term marks of his constant vigilance

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.110
suggest that he's more meticulous than he appears.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.840
His reluctance to show his teeth

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.150
shows

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.440
that he's tight-lipped

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.230
and prefers to conceal his thoughts.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.400
His strong and jutting chin

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.550
is a symbol of toughness and aggression,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.280
but the relaxed facial muscles suggest

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.630
that he's not prone to extremes.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.400
So,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.000
Heiguan is someone

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.070
who won't put too much pressure on himself

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.710
even when faced with a challenging task.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.320
Zhang,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.400
based on what I've just explained,

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.960
take another look at this face

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.190
and tell me how you feel now.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.320
He seems sullen

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.510
and indifferent.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.920
Now, focus on the corners of his mouth.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.920
I can't pinpoint it,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.880
but something feels strange.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:22.760
He's ruthless

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.670
and brutal.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.630
I don't usually care about such features in ordinary people,

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.070
but these details

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.710
shouldn't appear on the face

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.400
of someone who collects herbs to cure others.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:40.590
Guys,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.440
as you all know,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.150
I'm a patient,

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.230
and I'm especially sensitive

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.760
to the presence of fellow patients.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.880
And Zhao Guizhen here

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.550
likely shares

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.400
the same condition as mine.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.280
Fellow patients, huh?

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.440
Exactly,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.440
he's a fellow patient.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.000
What kind of condition is it?

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.960
Should we give them a beating?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.710
I've never been scared

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.320
of a fight.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.150
Bao,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.000
enough with the beating and fighting.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.480
We're here for Chen Duo this time.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.280
Right,

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.150
we've got all the info on the village,

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.110
but how are we supposed to find Chen Duo?

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.150
That's easy.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.150
Bao,

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.230
tell them

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.880
what to do when problems arise.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.110
If there's a problem,

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.360
talk to Si.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.480
That's the way to do it!

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.590
We must respect our leaders.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.110
As those working under them,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.920
we must constantly seek their advice.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.960
Our leaders are always wise

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.880
and visionary.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:54.440
For minor issues,

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.920
we must avoid bothering them.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.760
We must always ease their burdens.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.320
For larger issues,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.070
we must follow their guidance.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.480
Only under their leadership

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.800
can we overcome

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.400
our confusion.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.550
Only under Xu Si's leadership can the Lubei Region

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.800
enter a new phase.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.920
Cut it out, Zhang Chulan.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.480
Your leader Xu Si isn't here,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.630
so stop buttering him up.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.280
Besides,

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.920
the headquarters

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:22.480
is the one in charge now.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.110
I know that.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.920
We're just used to

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.710
rehearsing

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.840
for the year-end party.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.920
Bao!

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:09.920
Why is it still running without a head?

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.400
I saw it.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.280
Its head fell off.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.000
I saw it already.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.920
This thing has quite some skill.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.670
Everyone, use your abilities to capture it.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:17.800
Got it.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.510
Boulder Toss.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.400
Boulder Toss?

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.320
Wang Ye?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.630
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.360
Good evening, Wang Ye.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.630
Good evening.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:14.320
Break.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.630
Wang Ye?

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.030
Why are you also here?

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.030
Lian,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.820
how come you're always around?

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:25.420
[Wang Ye, Gate of Gale]

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.000
Is that your friend?

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.400
It's complicated.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.440
I'll explain it to you later.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.590
Come with me.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.320
Mr. Ye.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.320
Wait for me!

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.110
What's the situation?

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840
Watch out.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.800
That person is hiding in there.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.150
A person?

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.510
Where's the person?

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.150
Wait.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:06.920
The person...

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.000
Where is the person

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.440
you were talking about?

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.510
Are you sure that's a person?

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.280
Where is it?

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.230
It seems like NDT Express

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.710
doesn't know everything.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.960
At least you know nothing

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:22.400
about Biyou Village.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.440
Bao,

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.110
where are you going?

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.150
Come back.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.280
This puppet appears to be moving.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.710
The puppet didn't move.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.400
Come back and join the team. It's time to wrap things up.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.920
You must have been mistaken.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.710
We can call it a day now.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:02.510
Well.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:03.360
Why are you scared?

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:04.800
I'm not scared.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.230
What could possibly scare me?

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.440
Let go of me.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.280
Come on.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.630
What's there to be scared of?

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.920
I'm not scared.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.550
Did you really not move?

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.480
Caught you.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.190
These guys

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.760
ruined my Ruhua!

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.710
Zhang Chulan.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:17.510
Is this thing alive?

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.030
Alive?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.280
You could say it's alive,

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.710
or you could say it's not.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:24.280
These are all magic weapons

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.590
empowered with the ability to use qi.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.320
Wang,

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.880
have you also crossed paths with Ma Xianhong before?

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.710
Not only have we crossed paths,

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.880
but he also invited me here.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.230
No wonder it can't be killed.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.590
For someone to make a puppet this strong,

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.760
this person's skills

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.880
are certainly praiseworthy.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.880
It looks quite real.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.360
They actually moved.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.400
Who moved?

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.230
Behind you.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.190
What's going on?

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:02.840
I was just getting to the most crucial part

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.230
when you interrupted me.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.590
Qing?

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:08.480
Zhang Chulan?

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.110
What brings you guys here?

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.670
Qing,

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:12.760
we tried calling and messaging you,

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.150
but you didn't answer.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.630
This is just too crude.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.510
Your friend here seems to know

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.550
a lot about these things.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:33.710
They're not just things.

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:35.360
They have names.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:36.550
They're called Ruhua.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.230
Don't wander around the village.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.230
This isn't a place for people like you.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:00.880
That's strange.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.320
This Zhuge Qing seems different

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.710
from the one I knew before.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.360
He managed to control Ruhua in just a few days.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.280
What are he and Ma Xianhong plotting?

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.660
