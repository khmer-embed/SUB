But the reality

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.200
is that these special agents are too headstrong,

by a very unique poison.

This poison

as nourishment.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.390
The victim's internal organs

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.390
will be corroded,

and these wounds

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.960
were caused

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.720
by the corrosive effects of the poison.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.080

there is no cure.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.590
The toxins she carries

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.880
are extremely dangerous.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.270
If they spread,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.310
they'll kill

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.000
every living thing that comes into contact with her.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.960
And of course,

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.680
it will affect

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.160
the ordinary world as well.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.110
She can't be left out there.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.310
Since

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.070
we must capture Chen Duo,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.830
who's better

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.240
than these temporary workers

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.510
to carry out the task?

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.070
After all,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.160
the original purpose of appointing special agents

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.480
was to handle tasks

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.550
like the one with Chen Duo.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.030
Mr. Zhao,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.030
isn't this a bit risky?

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.030
You're handing danger a free pass.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.350
As long as this position exists,

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.880
they will always remain

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.510
employees of NDT Express.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.110
If we can't even trust

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.960
our own employees,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.400
who else can we trust?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.110
Pause

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.590
the operation for now.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.350
I'm with Mr. Zhao on this.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240
Let me make my stance clear.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.830
If any issues arise with the temporary worker

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880
in the Lubei Region,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.310
I'll take full responsibility.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.270
It's only right that you take responsibility.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.110
That's hardly a bargaining chip.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.590
I have one suggestion.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.640
During the mission,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.030
the headquarters should assume

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.160
full control

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.110
over all regional supervisors' powers,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.880
including communication with the special agents.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.960
NDT Express may be big,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.750
but it can't afford to handle another Chen Duo.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.110
All right.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.350
It's settled.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.000
Gather the temporary workers

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.920
from all six regions immediately

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.830
and bring Chen Duo back,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.880
by any means necessary.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680
If they can't bring her back

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.720
or if more issues arise with other temporary workers,

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.110
then we'll have to follow Bi's suggestion.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.720
The position

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.790
of temporary worker

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.310
might just become a thing of the past.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.790
Other temporary workers

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.790
must be thoroughly investigated as well.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.480
This matter will be handled directly by the headquarters.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.070
They will be sent to the bunker,

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.720
those who are uncovered as problematic

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.030
should not be allowed to return.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.480
Chulan.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.830
San, Si,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.830
what happened?

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.830
Something did happen.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.920
Liao Zhong from the Lunan Region is dead.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.350
It's suspected that his temporary worker,

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.240
Chen Duo, is responsible for the murder.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.160
Now, the headquarters

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.510
is teaming up with the other five temporary workers

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.240
to capture the fugitive.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.400
They want her alive if possible,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.750
or dead if necessary.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.750
This joint operation

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.160
will be directly led by the headquarters.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.270

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.030
ever worked together

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.110
since the system was established?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.510
Nice job, lad.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.590
You're quite sharp.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.680
They've never worked together before.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:38.590
This is the first time.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.270
The temporary worker system

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.350
was created by my father

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.920
specifically for him and Bao.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.350
It keeps Bao's identity secret

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.720
and allows her

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.640
to move freely in the world without being noticed.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.270
It's the most effective method

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.240
my father came up with to better protect Bao.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.350
Chulan,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.680

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.920
what our biggest headache is right now?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.510
When the temporary workers assemble this time,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.720
they'll meet each other,

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.830
and their true identities will be revealed,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.680
including Bao's.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.880
What if we refuse?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.070
If we refuse,

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.640
the headquarters will have an excuse

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.070
to investigate the temporary worker in the Lubei region.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.270
The worst-case scenario

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.790
is that the Lubei temporary worker position

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.640
could be revoked,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.000
and Bao

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.400
might lose the protection

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.960
of her special agent status.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.350
If her identity is exposed,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.000
we all know

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.750
the consequences.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.240
It seems we have no other option.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.510

the headquarters' control over you will be limited.
