00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.980
[Name: Chen Duo. Is this person an Outsider? Yes]

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.830
Let Chen Duo out?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.960
Liao,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.080
are you serious?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.600
According to these documents,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.320
the Poison Girl has not been cured.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.320
What if we allowed her limited access

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.280
to the normal world

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.870
under surveillance?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.510
We've tested Chen Duo.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.520
After this period of training,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.840
her control has greatly improved.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.640
She can now

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.710
fully manage

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470
the poison within her,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.280
and with the protection suit,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.640
the risks are completely controllable.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.320
Liao Zhong.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960
Let me be clear.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.430
She's not yet cured,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.520
and even if she were,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.200
this isn't something we can easily agree on.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.430
She's not like the Body of Disruption and other cases we've dealt with.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.390
We've been involved in every step

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.790
of her rebirth.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.200
To put it bluntly,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.310
her life belongs to the company.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.070
Now,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.230
are we really going to continue wasting resources on her

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.430
just to cater to her personal feelings?

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.120
Do you even know whose money we're spending here?

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.590
I'm not denying

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.280
the Poison Girl's innocence,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.790
but

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.350
do you really think she deserves

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.920
this unnecessary expense?

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.790
Liao,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.640
I see where you're coming from.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.760
But this time,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.430
I'm on Mr. Bi's side.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.870
We're not a charity

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.070
and what we need is stability.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.560
Of course, I admit

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.510
that sometimes,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.000
there's just nothing we can do to help.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.760
I know that Chen Duo's current situation

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.230
doesn't entitle her to these privileges,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.150
but what if she

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.040
could contribute

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.150
to our cause?

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.680
Her abilities are documented in her file.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.040
The person currently working under me

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.480
is in poor health

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.590
and has been wanting to step down.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.480
What if the replacement is someone

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.680
who has mastered the poison technique?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.310
I understand that Chen Duo is a special case,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.000
which is why I've come to the board

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.590
to seek everyone's approval.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.560
If the Saint Poison Girl

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.560
could become the next temporary worker,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.630
do you think

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.560
the investment would be worth it?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.360
We need

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.360
to give this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.430
more thought.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.870
We've reached a conclusion, Liao.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.750
You can proceed.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.800
But

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.630
you'll be fully accountable.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.870
How you handle security matters

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.080
is up to you,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.280
but necessary precautions must be taken.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.520
Once this collar

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.560
is on, it can never be removed.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.910
If the Poison Girl shows any signs of losing control,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.310
eliminate her.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.710
Ultimately, you must understand

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.150
that even if she wears the same clothes,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.400
she is not

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.680
one of us.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.680
Chen Duo,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.470
I've gotten you

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.240
the freedom you asked for.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.190
Due to the uncontrollable nature of Chen Duo's poison,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.630
she must wear this collar,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.430
which can be detonated at any time,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.840
as a necessary safety measure when she goes out

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.590
on missions.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.920
Mr. Liao.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.240
Thank you.

Your mission is simple.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.190
Find the person on the list

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.950

During the mission,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.390
you must strictly follow

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.120
our designated route.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.270
Stay safe.

retreat immediately.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.190
Most importantly,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.000
do not engage with anyone unrelated to the mission.

Mr. Liao,

mission accomplished.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.950
Liao,

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.000
there are some things I'd like to talk to you about.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.920
What's wrong?

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.120
The data from this kid's recent missions

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.310
has been incredibly stable.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.120
Isn't that a good thing?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.680
No.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.600
I mean, she's too stable.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.600
Since her first mission,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.070
her heart rate has never exceeded 75 bpm.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.390
We've been amazed

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.310
by her incredible learning ability

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.510
these past few years,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.120
but we've overlooked

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.310
her nature as a normal person.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.830
A normal person needs

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.510
a relatively normal environment to learn.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.160
Do you think this Bunker

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.480
is normal?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.160
You and I both know

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.800
that what she truly wants

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.190
is probably to live like a normal person.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.480
I'll take care of the risk control.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.560
Or do you have a better solution?

Do you realize

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.600
how much harm

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.200
it would do to her body

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.360
if she keeps the poison

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.630
suppressed like this?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.870
If she reaches a point where she can't control it anymore,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.120
it'll be dangerous.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.910
This is like gambling with her life.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.790
We must stop this right now.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.840
If all she wanted was to leave the Bunker,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.720
she didn't need to do all this.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.750
This child is risking her life for us,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.240
making herself harmless.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.080
She's not good at expressing herself,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.480
but I think she understands.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.510
She knows

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.600
this is her only way to connect

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.390
with the normal world right now.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.480
We should honor her determination.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:19.870
Liao,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.440
I'm a bit concerned.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.550
I'm worried that we might have gotten it wrong from the start.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.960
Do you remember

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.750
when we first brought her out of the Bunker

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.790
and into normal society?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.000
Her data didn't show

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.790
a single abnormal fluctuation.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.550
Maybe

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.480
she doesn't care

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.720
about living like a normal human at all.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.320
She

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.000
doesn't seem to care about anything.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.000
You're just overthinking it.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.960
If she truly didn't care,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.960
why would she risk her life

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.390
just to prevent the poison from spreading?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.870
The latest mission

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.080
involves a target

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.320
responsible for the deaths of eleven people,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.670
including seven ordinary people

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.720
and four employees sent by the company to search for her.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.150
The target is extremely dangerous.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.840
This person is quick to escape.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.240
Go ahead and take action.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.870
This area is uninhabited.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.630
Bring the target back to the company,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.030
regardless of whether she's alive or dead.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.630
Chief... Chief Ma.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.790
Who did this to you?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.390
Chief Ma,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.870
help me.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.320
You stole my magic weapon

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.320
and wreaked havoc out there,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.390
and now you're asking me to help you?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.510
I admit my fault, Chief Ma.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.510
Help me.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.030
Help me.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.510
The ghost...

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.840
The ghost is here!

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.360
You did this on your own?

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.480
Not bad.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.320
Never mind.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.960
She brought it upon herself anyway.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.910
Please leave her here.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.480
Come on, cut me some slack.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.910
She committed a wrongdoing,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.440
and I need to bring her back for questioning.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:38.750
Sir,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.270
the tracker on Chen Duo shows

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.750
irregular movements within a limited area.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.200
It's not a pursuit.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.120
It's a fight.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.080
Chen Duo.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.480
The target has accomplices.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.390
There are three of them.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.270
Three?

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.080
What's the situation?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.030
Can you handle it?

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:54.960
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:55.960
No,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.910
they're impressive.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.120
The opponents

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.000
are using techniques I've never seen before.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.360
Chen Duo, listen to me.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.320
Retreat for now.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.510
I'll come to assist you immediately.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.630
Hang in there, Chen Duo.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.360
Hang in there.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.270
Chen Duo.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.390
Chen Duo, answer me.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.510
Chen Duo, answer me.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.240
Sir,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.600
it's disappeared.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.150
Chen Duo's tracker can no longer be detected.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.600
How is that possible?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.240
The tracker is implanted in her body.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.670
It shouldn't disappear, even if she's taken down.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.790
Not unless she vanished into thin air.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.120
She's a tough one to handle.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.510
What's her trick?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.870
She's a poisoner,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.390
no doubt about it.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.600
But it's quite unusual

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.720
for someone her age

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.720
to be at the grandmaster level.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.870
Chen Duo!

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.600
Chen Duo!

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.270
Chen Duo!

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.720
Chen Duo!

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.480
Chen Duo!

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.080
You were the one who put the collar on her,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.440
and the controller is in your hands.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.750
Now, you can end this yourself.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.600
I'll give you seventy-two hours.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.120
If Chen Duo's exact location

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.790
isn't found within that time,

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.320
you know what to do.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.200
If you can't make the decision by then,

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.720
we'll handle it for you.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.390
You're awake.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.000
Wait.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.390
Your skills are certainly impressive,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.480
but there's no need for you to target me.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.080
I won't make things hard for you.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.790
This is your work, huh?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.720
She died before making it here.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.630
What exactly is the source of your power?

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.670
I've examined you,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.080
but I've never seen anything like this.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.750
Mission

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.390
accomplished.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.510
No matter what she did wrong,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.270
she's still a person,

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.320
a life.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.910
She died at your hands.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.600
Is this your only reaction?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.360
I must accomplish every mission

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.200
that Mr. Liao assigns to me.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.910
He says she has done too much evil

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.150
and deserves to die.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.270
You...

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.390
Forget it.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.440
She's already dead.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.960
No point in saying anything more.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.870
I'll get you something to eat.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.510
The doctor in the village has checked

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.640
and said it's probably not contagious.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.350
But just to be safe,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.880
perhaps we should learn more about her.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.710
Is that so?

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.820
What a pity.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.540
She might have already left.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.820
Why is she still here?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.740
Where's the food?

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:58.850
Chief Ma,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.890
how about

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.610
I ask Fu Rong to set up two more tables?

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.170
Even though that person brought this upon herself,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.060
she was still my companion.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.650
You've taken her out,

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.610
and now you're expecting me to drink with you

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.020
and hold a farewell party?

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.810
We've cleared everything up.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.610
I won't make things difficult for you.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.810
You can leave now.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.740
Leave?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.090
Where to?

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.980
Is she trying to blackmail me?

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.260
Someone will come to pick me up.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.810
Are you looking for the communicator?

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.370
It broke during our fight.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.410
Also,

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.220
I found a tracker on you,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.020
removed it,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.890
and destroyed it.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.130
Sorry,

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.890
but no one's coming to pick you up.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.570
I'll take you to the village entrance.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:28.810

[Biyou Village]

This road will lead you out of the village.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.020
I won't be seeing you off.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:00.570
Have a safe trip.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.780
Huang, come here.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.060
Where should I go?

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.020
Go wherever you want.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.170
It's your freedom.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.370
No one can stop you.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:33.980
Freedom.

[Biyou Village]

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.780
Chief Ma.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.980
I'm actually a bit curious about you now.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.780
Could you tell me more about yourself?

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.700
You mean,

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.980
myself?

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.810
This is the collar you've been wearing all this time.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.890
You're lucky.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.850
Not many people can take it off.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.410
While you were unconscious,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.740
I examined it

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.330
and made a switch.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.740

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.460
is what they've left on you.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.260
If you have nowhere else to go,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.890
you can stay in the village.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.940
I've studied your condition,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.170
and if I can complete my invention,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.330
there's a chance I could cure you.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.330
Can I

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.370
do that?

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.810
It's not about whether you can or can't,

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.700
it's whether you want to.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:36.940
But

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.940
it's not convenient for me to stay elsewhere.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.460
I'm aware of that.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.980
I can create an environment

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.260
that's suitable for you to live in.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.940
Just tell me

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.300
if you still want to go back

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.500
to that Bunker.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.330
Don't stress about the rest.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.410
It's all about what you want.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.220
I don't want to go back,

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.740
but I'd like to see Mr. Liao one more time.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.370
He's always

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.330
had my best interests at heart.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.890
He researched you

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.130
and trained you to kill,

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.330
yet you still think he has your best interests at heart?

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.650
Can you help me put it back on?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.090
I really have no idea what you're thinking.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.610
I don't know either,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.650
which is why I want to go and find out.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:13.940
Hello.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.530
Chen Duo,

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:17.980
where are you?

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.050
Not far at all.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.090
I'll be there soon.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.420
You went alone?

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.290
Didn't you bring anyone with you?

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.850
I'm the closest to Chen Duo,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.130
so I went ahead.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.050
I've informed the others as well,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.530
so don't worry. Everything is under control.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.220
Turn on the receiver

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.900
so we can stay updated.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.130
Send me the location.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.220
Those who took Chen Duo

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.570
don't seem to want any trouble.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.940
They brought her back

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.500
after clarifying the situation.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.020
Chen Duo!

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.660
Chen Duo!

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.900
Chen Duo!

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.700
Chen Duo.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.020
Chen Duo!

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.290
Mr. Liao.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.940
Chen Duo!

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.130
Are you all right?

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.660
Did those people give you a hard time?

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.220
No.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.260
Good, that's a relief.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.020
You gave me quite a scare.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.700
You were right to choose this place to meet.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.220
From now on, always inform me

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.700
about any issues you encounter.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.420
Tell me what those people did to you

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.900
on the way back.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.850
I won't let them get away with it.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.090
Let's go.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.530
Chen Duo.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.610
Let's go.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.740
Mr. Liao,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.420
is it all right

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.900
if I don't go back?

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.330
Mr. Liao,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.570
is it all right

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:13.850
if I don't go back?

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.850
Silly girl,

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.260
what are you talking about?

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.570
I'm here to pick you up.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:31.130
Come with me.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.220
Mr. Liao.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.660
Come with me!

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.180
Let's go.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.770
Mr. Liao.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.740
Shut up.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.130
Don't speak a word from now on.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.330
Shut up!

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.850
Mr. Liao,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:52.740
I'm not going back.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.980
I told you to shut up!

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.090
What's so hard to understand?

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.420
Liao Zhong, do it.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.610
Mr. Bi,

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:00.570
everyone,

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.180
this child is sick.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.220
Yes, she's sick.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.180
Just give me some time.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.330
I'll take her back right away.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.460
Don't worry,

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.530
Mr. Liao.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.290
Someone says he can help cure me.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.180
Chen Duo, what are you talking about?

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.180
So what if someone said that?

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.460
It doesn't matter.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.810
Do you hear me?

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.260
Those things aren't important.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.220
What matters is that you come back with me right now.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.020
Yes, Mr. Liao.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.500
None of that matters.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.290
Neither the company

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.810
nor the bunker

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.740
matters.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.330
What matters to me

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.570
is you.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.090
Chen Duo,

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.740
don't push me!

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.530
Liao Zhong,

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.050
the Poison Girl has begun to have second thoughts

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.290
and is no longer useful to us.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.260
Do it now.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.900
Mr. Bi, just give me a moment.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:04.980
I'll knock her out

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.220
and bring her back.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.130
Have you lost your mind?

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:16.980
What have you

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.020
done to me?

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.020
This is what happened

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.940
behind Chen Duo's defection.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.260
Why?

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.770
Why did you go to see Liao?

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.530
Do you think he'd kill you?

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.260
He wouldn't.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.570
Liao's not that kind of person.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.810
Why?

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.180
That doesn't make sense.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.220
The story Chen Duo told Meng

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.740
doesn't quite add up.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.290
The whole situation seems to make sense at first,

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.420
but there are a few parts that don't really add up.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.420
If Chen Duo really wanted to escape,

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.130
she could have easily avoided Liao Zhong

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.330
and disappeared alone.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.700
Why would she return

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.770
to see him for one last time

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.130
and put herself in that situation?

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:38.770
According to the autopsy,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.090
Liao Zhong did die from Chen Duo's poison.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.460
But his internal organs

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.420
were gradually corroded.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.850
Yes,

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.090
that's the key point.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.700
If Chen Duo only wanted to leave the company

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.370
and gain the so-called freedom,

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.810
she wouldn't need to return

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.290
and meet Liao Zhong for the last time.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.940
Even if

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.130
she did return,

00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:59.980
based on her account,

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.460
it doesn't seem like things

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.980
had escalated to the point where she had to kill Liao Zhong.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.810
Chen Duo must be hiding something

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.330
about this matter,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.940
and we need to get to the bottom of it.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.530
Ma Xianhong,

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.260
you'd better stick to your so-called principles.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.020
Don't hand Chen Duo over just yet,

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.980
or I'll be in a bind.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:22.460
If we can uncover

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.050
the truth hidden by Chen Duo,

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.660
we can resolve this.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.940
However, regarding this particular matter,

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.610
my inherent flaw is a major problem.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:32.700
I know nothing

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.940
about women.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.330
Why?

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.770
Why?

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.020
Those guys

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.330
have likely spotted the issue.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.460
Actually,

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.610
they might be able to answer my questions,

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.180
but I can't exactly ask them.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.330
After all, they are my biggest threat

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.700
on this trip.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.700
Perhaps I should consider Bao's opinion

00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.090
as sometimes,

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.610
she does have a unique way

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.090
of looking at things.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.130
Wait a minute.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.090
I'm not drunk enough to do that.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.460
Maybe Wang could help?

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.740
No,

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.660
he's pretty smart,

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.330
but he's the type

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.090
who doesn't waste time

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.900
on women.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.050
Besides, right now, he's either searching for the Refining Furnace

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.180
or resting up

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.260
to take down Ma Xianhong and Zhuge Qing.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:27.570
Oh,

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.420
how could I forget about that guy?

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.770
It's truly a sad story.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.610
The protagonist of the story

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.610
must be Chen Duo, right?

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.500
No.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.610
Stop making wild guesses.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.370
Zhang Chulan,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.770
you say you're clueless about women,

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.980
but I think

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.460
you're actually quite clever.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.090
You've unwittingly

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.740
pinpointed the core of the issue:

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.180
women.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.810
Women?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.500
Yes.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.900
You wonder why the heroine

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.420
would conceal the truth in a way

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.980
that's so easy to expose.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.420
Based on what you've told me,

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.020
I think it's most likely

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.020
that she doesn't care about being found out.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.050
No matter how much you press her,

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.180
she won't tell you the truth

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.810
because, in the end, the story

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.290
is about the memories shared between a man and a woman,

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.330
a secret just for the two of them.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.290
At the end of the story,

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.180
the heroine put on the deadly collar,

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.660
giving up her hard-won freedom,

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.260
just to see the hero one last time.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:22.940
Those things aren't important.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.530
What matters is that you come back with me right now.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.610
Yes, Mr. Liao.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.050
None of that matters.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:30.740
What matters to me

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.180
is you.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.900
Doesn't this show

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.610
how important the hero is to the heroine?

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.900
People

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:46.530
leave

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.980
or come to a place

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:48.980
for the same reason.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.220
It all depends

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.770
on whether it offers something they truly want.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.370
The heroine going to meet the hero

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.460
wasn't so much about saying goodbye.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.530
It was more about weighing her options.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.730
If the hero could give her

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.210
what she was looking for,

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:14.860
she might have stayed.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.500
Zhang Chulan,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.500
to uncover the truth,

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:19.900
you need to figure out

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.500
what the heroine truly desires.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.130
But the hero is already dead.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.170
How am I supposed to know?

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:28.420
Just make a guess.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:29.340
A guess?

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.050
Yes,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.380
you have to guess.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.690
♪The thoughts of a girl♪

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.420
♪They are not for you to guess, boy♪

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.860
♪You'll never guess them right, no matter how hard you try♪

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.820
Take dating as an example.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.900
Those who can flirt with women

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.650
are just beginners.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.860
Those who pamper women

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.300
are intermediate.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.170
But those who truly understand women

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.340
are the real masters.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.420
But this is too complicated,

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.050
and they're not even lovers.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.730
Wait a minute.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.780
I think I get it now.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.170
I gave up my freedom

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.500
and risked death

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.170
just to see you one more time.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.460
Because you

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.500
are more important to me

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.570
than my freedom and even my life.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.610
I don't need to search far and wide.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.380
The path

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.130
lies in your hands.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.730
I see it now.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.210
I see it. Give it to me.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.610
Give me what I want.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.170
Just give it to me.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.860
I...

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.650
Qing, with that exaggerated acting of yours,

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.530
how did you manage to stay in the crew?

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.380
Is that even related?

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.340
Your analysis is logically sound.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.090
The hero is both a strict teacher

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.170
and a caring father

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.250
to the heroine,

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.210
but clearly,

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.420
he hasn't given her the outcome she desires.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.300
There's also the sad possibility

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.530
that the man gave her

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.170
the wrong thing.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.980
Gave her the wrong thing?

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.020
There are men

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.380
who are perfect in every way.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.820
They give wholeheartedly,

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.570
even going so far as to assume

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.090
they know exactly what the other person wants.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.380
But once a conflict

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.460
arises over this,

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.770
if the man doesn't realize his mistake soon enough,

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.210
the relationship is doomed

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.610
to fall apart.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.900
They just don't understand

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.610
what women want,

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:38.940
and there are plenty

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.170
of such men.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.460
All right,

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.690
I've said enough.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.730
I should head back now.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.980
Whatever you're planning to do,

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.210
good luck.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.060
Qing,

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:50.020
since we don't see each other often,

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.170
let's talk a bit more.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.730
Wang Ye

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.650
told me about what happened with you.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.380
So, about Ma Xianhong

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.340
and the Refining Furnace,

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.820
you didn't get involved,

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.730
did you?

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.650
Are you

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.980
asking me this as the employee

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.060
of NDT Express?

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.060
As your friend.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.730
In that case, I've got nothing more to say.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:22.900
Sorry.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.500
Qing,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.540
you're pretty close to Ma Xianhong now.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.060
If push comes to shove,

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.210
we won't end up as enemies,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.090
right?

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.500
Zhang Chulan, you know,

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.940
the most fascinating thing about fate

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.730
is that the future is always full of uncertainty.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.090
If you ask me now,

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.610
all I can say is this:

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.020
it can't be predicted.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.860
I'm off.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.340
According to Qing,

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.090
what Chen Duo wants can only be guessed.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.020
The private matters between her and Liao Zhong

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.420
are impossible to ask about.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.250
This guy is indeed adept

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.610
when it comes to matters between men and women.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.980
But he overlooked one thing,

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.380
what's Ma Xianhong's role in this?

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.690
Freedom?

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.250
No,

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.690
based on Qing's analysis,

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.860
Liao Zhong has

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.340
what Chen Duo truly wants,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.900
and it's clearly not freedom.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.820
I must ask her again

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.570
and not miss a single detail.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.700
That's not how basketball is played.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.910
I scored!

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.180
You seem to be great at basketball.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.580
Who taught you?

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:21.620
A

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.660
friend.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.100
A friend you made in the village?

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.220
A friend from the Bunker.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.260
His name is Chen Junyan.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.990
Have you heard of him?

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.220
Why did you come

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.660
to see me?

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.950
Chen Duo.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.660
Chen Duo.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.220
Could you tell me

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.660
the detailed story of how you arrived here?

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.030
Yes.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.260
Chief Ma brought me back to Biyou Village.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.350
He told me

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.030
I no longer need to return to the Bunker,

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.260
but I still wanted to see Mr. Liao again.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:13.950
Chen Duo,

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.140
what did you do to Liao Zhong

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.830
before he died?

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.220
I asked him to end my life.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.620
Chen Duo,

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.310
don't push me!

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.390
Liao Zhong,

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:34.780
the Poison Girl has begun to have second thoughts

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.070
and is no longer useful to us.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:36.830
Do it now.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.550
Mr. Bi, just give me a moment.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.550
I'll knock her out

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:40.780
and bring her back.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.390
Mr. Liao.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.510
Chen Duo,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.830
don't push me.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.350
Mr. Liao,

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.430
I was right to come here.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:17.950
What?

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.550
I'm happy.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.510
I've never felt this happy.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.580
Mr. Liao,

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.300
let me leave.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.180
Do it.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.260
That's an order.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.100
Do it!

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.070
No.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.180
Then,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.300
come with me.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.660
No!

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.580
In that case,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.660
Mr. Liao,

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.830
end my life.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.140
Have you lost your mind?

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.740
Liao Zhong,

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.030
what happened?

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.300
Liao Zhong, answer me.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.700
Liao Zhong!

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.470
What have you

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.390
done to me?

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.620
The Primordial Poison.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.550
You once told me

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.990
that the essence of the poison technique

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.070
is to make my internal organs

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.350
a breeding ground for these toxins,

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:53.950
which are the Primordial Poison.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.620
They feed on the qi within my body.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.580
If I lose my qi,

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.950
the poison

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.870
will immediately lose its power.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.300
Now,

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.580
Mr. Liao,

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.300
end my life.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:26.470
Once I'm dead,

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.100
the poison in you will be gone too.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.140
Liao Zhong,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.950
what's going on right now?

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:41.470
Liao Zhong.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.140
Liao Zhong, answer me.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.990
Liao Zhong.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:51.910
Liao Zhong!

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.430
Is this what it feels like

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.390
to have something like this planted in your body?

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.870
All this time,

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.660
you've been enduring this pain,

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.300
haven't you?

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.220
Chen Duo,

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.030
I know you want to run away,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.660
but doing that

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.660
will only make things worse.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.180
Hold on

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.260
to what you've been wanting the most

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.740
this whole time.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.070
I'm here with you.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:44.780
Don't give up.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:57.740
Mr. Liao,

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.430
so you really don't get it at all.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.350
In the Bunker,

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.620
you all taught me many things.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.740
You said I was a fast learner

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.220
and praised me for being smart.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.390
Were you lying to me?

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.950
If you weren't,

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.350
then why are you treating me like a fool now?

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.140
Why do you think

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.350
I'm stupid enough

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.950
to want a "normal" life?

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.260
Even if you can cure my body,

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:44.950
can you

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.350
make this part of me

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.470
normal too?

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.350
Can you give me

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.070
a so-called "normal" past?

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.780
I've never cared about those things.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.140
For me,

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.830
what can make me happiest is simple.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:57.300
♪Her descent to the land is like the cries of a newborn♪

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:04.180

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.700
Mr. Liao is dead.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.390
This is the entire story.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.550
Only by using this method

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.180
could Liao Zhong understand what you wanted.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.030
Unfortunately,

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.390
he never did, not even until his death.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.140
But I still have to thank you,

00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:58.070
Liao Zhong.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.660
I will make good use

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.950
of the poisonous flower

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:05.390
you nurtured with your own blood.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.510
Did you do this?

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:04.470
Morning.

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.510
Meng?

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.390
Chen Junyan says something has happened to Chen Duo.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.740
What is this strange thing?

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.870
It must be Chief Ma

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.470
who didn't want you near me,

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.470
so he isolated this place.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:37.740
Ma Xianhong,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.430
let me out.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.180
Ma Xianhong!

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.870
Is this Chief Ma some kind of freak?

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.430
Does he enjoy locking people up?

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.180
I don't think so.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.550
Chief Ma

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.780
is a good person.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.430
The divine crafts that forge tangible power,

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.990
coupled with techniques that utilize abstract forces,

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:22.910
create a perfect combination.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:26.910
Zhuge Qing used the ultimate phantasmagoria technique

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.870
to guide the Refining Furnace in the correct direction.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.300
The techniques are evolving endlessly,

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.470
and the structure of the divine crafts keeps improving.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.830
By giving Zhuge Qing the Divine Forge,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.620
I triggered the awakening of the Refining Furnace.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.580
Now, I can finally recover my memories.
